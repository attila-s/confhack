[Music] 
 hey 
 on it's on 
 [Music] 
 mainly here as a recruitment drive we 
 have you know plenty of open roads in 
 the piping space 
 both in core app development django 
 flask and and across full stack as well 
 in terms of doing something special for 
 the attendees we have a really 
 interesting speaker this year in terms 
 of nile o'connor talking about asset 
 price reversals 
 without the normal swag and a special 
 gift for people and we'll be doing some 
 some raffles and giveaways um and if 
 there's anyone who wants to talk to us 
 at the desk we're here all through the 
 conference i guess we chose europe 
 because a it's in dublin and it's the 
 first time since peak overtimes i've 
 been able to get people together and 
 really you know promote what we do in in 
 bank america in terms of python um 
 you know it's a very much uh a python 
 focused uh conference which is really 
 where our tech stack lies and where a 
 lot of our projects are within bank of 
 america 
 so hi my name is marianne shine and i'm 
 the head of hr and operations with 
 umnitza in ireland 
 so this is umnitz's first year to 
 sponsor your python we're so excited to 
 celebrate this year and participate in 
 europe python 
 coming to ireland so umnitza is a u.s 
 company with our r d based in galway in 
 the west of ireland we have employees 
 all over ireland and we thought this 
 would be a great opportunity to bring 
 them along today and participate in the 
 ecosystem the the python ecosystem and 
 really learn from 
 other professionals within this area 
 this year we're actually sponsoring the 
 pie ladies lunch so nitsa are very 
 passionate about gender diversity within 
 our engineering team in galway we 
 currently have 33 
 um females in our team and so we're very 
 privileged and honored to sponsor the 
 pie ladies lunch which i think is taking 
 place on friday so we're very excited to 
 be here i think europe python is a very 
 unique conference ladies and gentlemen 
 please take a moment to locate your 
 nearest fire exit 
 in the unlikely event of an evacuation 
 please follow the directions of the ccd 
 staff and proceed directly outside 
 please do not attempt to re-enter the 
 building until told that it is safe to 
 do so 
 hello there hello hello good morning 
 everyone 
 um well welcome to hero python day two 
 i hope um i hope everyone is good how 
 are you feeling so far are we all right 
 wow that's a lot of energy 
 good 
 very good 
 um well thank you very much for joining 
 us so early again we're very very happy 
 to have you here very nice to see all 
 the smiles 
 and that everyone is enjoying because we 
 put this party together for you 
 um 
 perfect so again first things first 
 safety precautions 
 masks are strongly recommended 
 we also have 
 hand sanitizers available throughout the 
 building 
 and to facilitate 
 interaction between all of us uh we also 
 designed some social distancing badges 
 just so people know what is your level 
 of comfort when they're approaching you 
 and then we have a new one so upon 
 requests people requested us to have a 
 fist bump 
 uh sticker so i designed the sticker 
 yesterday and we're going to pick it up 
 this afternoon so if you're the yellow 
 that only wants a fist bump just goes to 
 reception pick one of those up with us 
 after lunch i think 
 cool 
 so 
 for the schedule 
 we ask you to please go to the website 
 uh because that's the one and only 
 source of truth 
 um and also if you want to speak to a 
 remote to a remote speaker or 
 if you want to talk to your speaker the 
 speaker that you're in the talk before 
 and you'd like to talk to them to like 
 do a little bit of the what we call the 
 hallway track uh please just join them 
 on at the leafy boardroom number four 
 and also this is a hybrid conference so 
 you can also well just go to the 
 ferryman and 
 do whatever you want 
 from there do your lightning talks from 
 the ferryman across the bridge um 
 cool 
 so 
 uh now to the events 
 so today so at the 
 we call how to a we have an open space 
 uh the basically the space where 
 everyone can go 
 and propose discussions um or just get 
 a subsection of the community together 
 um this morning at 11 a.m 
 we have the eps the 
 euro python society internal discussions 
 and at 11 am and then in the afternoon 
 from 2 p.m we have our mender's fringe 
 with our lovely chuck we met we met her 
 yesterday on the lightning docks 
 um and this is a preparation for people 
 they're not comfortable with doing their 
 their prs just yet uh so they could go 
 to the mentored print and learn how to 
 do that for the sprint's day they're 
 going to be in the last two days of the 
 conference on the weekly the weekend 
 ones 
 and then 
 at the forum downstairs where the food 
 happened yesterday 
 we are going to have the northern 
 ireland raspberry jam folks for the 
 maker fest 
 and well we 
 heard rumors 
 that they might have brought a robot 
 maze 
 to the building but we don't really know 
 so you might just go there and talk to 
 them you know 
 then at 
 1 pm we also have a community organizers 
 lunch 
 at the level five 
 so if you would like to go and join the 
 community organizers just talk to us and 
 see what's going on please just join 
 and then tomorrow 
 we have the pi ladies lunch 
 at 1 p.m also at the level 5. 
 um 
 let's see 
 um some more events 
 then we have a sponsorship recruitment 
 session uh at well 11 55 
 at the leafy a 
 and there is an online job board going 
 on at the website so ep 2022.0 
 jobs hyphen board and there's also a 
 physical job board at the forum 
 downstairs 
 and then yes so today is finally the day 
 at social event 
 we've been prepping this a lot 
 of dedication for you and well 
 i am glad to tell you so thank you very 
 much that our tickets are sold out i'm 
 sorry thank you very much for everyone 
 that purchased one 
 but we also have a favor to ask you so 
 if if you bought one and you're not sure 
 if you want to go 
 you might not go we ask you to maybe try 
 and reallocate that ticket because since 
 they were sold out so fast there's a lot 
 of people that actually really want to 
 go 
 um and we can't cater for them anymore 
 um 
 so yes and there's also going to be a 
 raffle 
 at the social event tonight 
 and live music and food 
 and drinks so i think it's going to be a 
 lot of fun 
 okay so just again 
 at the weekend we're going to have the 
 mentor sprint this print sorry not the 
 mentored ones mentored when the demented 
 one is today 
 um 
 you can propose 
 if you have a project that you'd like 
 people to work on you can propose at the 
 at our website as well um and people are 
 going to work on it on the weekend 
 then let's see so if 
 all of this gets too much or if you need 
 a little bit of a break uh we have a 
 quiet room um going on on weeklo how to 
 be 
 so it's a nice large room that people 
 can just go to and sit down and be quiet 
 for a bit or do a little bit of work 
 [Music] 
 then 
 let's see 
 oh wonderful so well we know that things 
 are not perfect we're doing the best we 
 can 
 this is a voluntary run event 
 after all but uh if you have any 
 feedback for us if you have any 
 suggestions 
 if you think if there's anything you 
 want to let us know we truly appreciate 
 so please just grab someone with a 
 yellow t-shirt 
 talk to me talk to vb talk to raquel 
 talk to any of us we're going to be more 
 than happy to take in your feedback 
 all right 
 and then 
 we would like to thank all of our 
 sponsors again um 
 and 
 uh well thank you very much again for 
 joining us this morning and well have 
 fun people 
 [Applause] 
 thank you 
 um 
 cool so now 
 i am going to 
 um call vicky to introduce our keynote 
 speaker of the day so thank you 
 good morning everyone i'm 
 oh my god i'm a fan already hey vivi 
 good morning everyone and i'm back again 
 and 
 i am actually very i'm here this morning 
 because i'm very excited to announce our 
 next keynote speaker 
 as someone that's me 
 who has been in the tech industry for 
 for some time 
 i've attended uh those in the past i've 
 attended our meetups and talks 
 and at some point in our careers and 
 lives definitely where i am right now we 
 eventually start thinking about ethics 
 and especially in the work we do 
 that impacts so many things on so many 
 levels 
 so 
 laura nolan is a software engineer who 
 focuses on software operations and 
 reliability she holds degree in computer 
 science and in ethics and is currently 
 completing another masters in strategic 
 studies 
 since 2018 
 laura has been part of the campaign to 
 stop killer robots 
 an umbrella organized organization of 
 ngos that works towards a legally 
 binding instrument to regulate 
 autonomous weapons 
 her talk is called killer robots 
 considered harmful 
 let's put our hands together and welcome 
 laura nolan 
 thank you very much good morning now uh 
 one moment while i fiddle with uh av 
 stuff oh here we go 
 are we good 
 can we 
 think i am connected 
 pardon me 
 oh here we go sorry 
 now is the part where i will drag 
 windows around the place 
 where did my slides go 
 so while laura's setting up i just want 
 to remind people that if you don't want 
 to be filmed there's a no film of video 
 zones that's marked out in all rooms 
 including 
 the auditorium here so if you want to 
 move to an area where there's no 
 video zones 
 uh please do so 
 are we good yes cool sorry about that 
 computer ate my slides temporarily 
 anyway good morning i am so happy to be 
 here i am from dublin so it's a great 
 privilege and honor to get to 
 speak to euro python in my own home city 
 so thank you very much for having me 
 so 
 just to sort of get things straight at 
 the start uh what is this talk about it 
 is not about 
 my worries that the robots will become 
 clever and smart and 
 you know overthrow humanity with their 
 super intelligence 
 um 
 that's the first thing that people think 
 about when we start throwing about terms 
 like autonomous weapons and killer 
 robots 
 but actually what i worry about is the 
 opposite thing that we will 
 introduce autonomous weapons and they 
 will be too stupid 
 so this photo here is um it's a bunch of 
 autonomous cars from a company called 
 cruise this was taken on june 30th this 
 year so only a couple of weeks back 
 and 
 this company is allowed to operate 30 
 autonomous cars in san francisco and 
 it's a la it has a license to pick up 
 passengers at night and drive them 
 around with no driver in the car 
 and of the 30 cars that they're allowed 
 to run um about 20 of these cars 
 basically decided to 
 pull in and sort of clog up 
 this junction in san francisco bringing 
 traffic to a grinding halt now there are 
 no lives lost here which is great but 
 then cars are not supposed to kill the 
 cars are supposed to avoid killing 
 people 
 what will happen if we 
 introduce a fleet of autonomous weapons 
 and all those weapons start doing stupid 
 things all at once or even one weapon 
 does a stupid thing once you know people 
 will die and that is what i worry about 
 so just a brief recap about who the heck 
 i am so 
 um i've been a software engineer or an 
 sre for my entire career 
 and i joined the campaign to stop killer 
 robots about four years ago and i will 
 tell you that story shortly 
 um it's super weird to wake up in the 
 morning and find the guardian and with 
 an op-ed that says you're a modern day 
 hero i'm not 
 i'm just doing the thing that i think is 
 the right thing to do and that i hope 
 that 
 all of you would do as well after you've 
 listened to this talk 
 so 
 here is my 
 backstory in 2017 i was working at 
 google and google at that point 
 had taken this secret contract with the 
 us department of defense to work on a 
 thing called project maven 
 this is the logo for project maven and 
 there's a little um motto here it says 
 officium nostrum est a duvari and that 
 means our job is to help 
 now i don't know who made up this logo 
 or what they were thinking but either 
 you know option one they thought this 
 was a cool logo and they'd never heard 
 of 
 i'm from the government and i'm here to 
 help 
 or else they did know about that and 
 it's extremely subversive but either way 
 it's pretty funny 
 so 
 2017 they kicked this project off and 
 basically the idea is 
 normal military government procurement 
 processes are slow and cumbersome and 
 what if they could get some of that you 
 know 
 private software industry kind of 
 special sauce and use it to supercharge 
 their military systems so that they 
 could have you know 
 warfare at the speed of thought and all 
 this kind of stuff 
 so 
 basically their problem was they had all 
 this video surveillance stuff this is 
 called wide area motion imagery and it's 
 the the video that you get when you fly 
 a drone over somewhere and you you 
 record that video so it's from high 
 above and you know got relatively little 
 detail but there is enough detail there 
 to pick out people moving around 
 vehicles moving that sort of thing 
 and you know they they fly these drones 
 over certain areas pretty much 
 continuously and so they end up with 
 this huge huge amount of video and they 
 literally cannot hire enough people to 
 actually do all the analysis on this 
 so 
 basically their idea here is automate 
 that okay so 
 that's fine you want to do some machine 
 learning what's the problem 
 well the problem is kind of this right 
 um 
 you know 
 at the end of that process 
 the start of the process is machine 
 learning yeah sure at the end of the 
 process is people getting blown up 
 um so this is a very very blunt quote 
 and apologies for any offense caused but 
 i think that jamie zowinski of mozilla 
 here is is correct 
 um 
 there's a thing called the military kill 
 chain and it starts off 
 identify your target dispatch forces to 
 your target 
 attack and then destroy 
 that's the kill chain and that is the 
 end 
 that's 
 you know maven was not a weapon but it's 
 very much 
 feeding information into the weapon 
 systems 
 i was not the only person at google that 
 was concerned about this project um 
 i knew about this a few weeks before it 
 went public 
 when it did go public um every art 
 department um for all of the tech kind 
 of publications went 
 went on a bit of a field day and 
 produced all these kinds of images 
 um 
 what i had been asked to do in 
 particular i wasn't asked to work on the 
 core maven project but what i was asked 
 to do was to help google set up new 
 air-gapped data centers 
 phase one of maven was 18 months long 
 and what they were going to do was 
 basically hand software to the dod so 
 handing 
 trained models and they also had some 
 you know pretty fancy plans for nice 
 uxes that would give you like a timeline 
 of people's activities and like 
 a little connected social graph of you 
 know who in which houses um visits who 
 and which other buildings 
 all this kind of stuff but what they 
 were asking me to do was help them to 
 run that software in-house in phase two 
 in these air-gapped data centers that 
 would have been 
 sort of um 
 supervised in operation by the us 
 military 
 so 
 i ended up leaving google and i started 
 speaking out publicly about this issue 
 and i joined the campaign to stop killer 
 robots 
 i still volunteer with them regularly 
 doing advocacy type work 
 so 
 ethics 101 i am not going to talk about 
 ethics 101 because this is a tech 
 conference and vicky said don't talk 
 about ethics laura talk about the tech 
 so um 
 for me my ethical stance against killer 
 robots is actually very grounded in 
 what i see as fundamental and probably 
 insoluble problems with the technology 
 so that's mainly what we're going to 
 talk about 
 if you do want ethics actually the good 
 place is pretty good i did a whole 
 master's degree in ethics and i learned 
 maybe nearly as much from the good place 
 anyway so it is what it is 
 so 
 tech stuff 
 so here is a sort of a 
 i guess very high level schematic of 
 your autonomous weapon 
 so 
 first off 
 an autonomous weapon is a weapon 
 that is not 
 it's not just any degree of autonomy um 
 you can have an autonomous drone that 
 flies autonomously that takes certain 
 degree decisions around 
 routing all this kind of stuff but when 
 we talk about an autonomous weapon we 
 talk about autonomy in the critical 
 functions 
 and that's targeting and the decision to 
 attack a particular target so target 
 identification and target selection 
 an autonomous drone that can 
 autonomously fly somewhere but a human 
 is making a decision to attack 
 we don't consider that an autonomous 
 weapon even though it has some 
 autonomous capabilities we're all about 
 the lethal stuff here those critical 
 functions of choosing the target 
 so 
 how targeting works is kind of key to 
 this whole argument 
 so 
 the autonomous weapons that we're seeing 
 emerge 
 or that have existed for some time in 
 sort of proto-autonomous form 
 they tend to use sensors to sense the 
 environment and then they make some 
 decisions internally so the sensors that 
 they use tend to be radar and lidar 
 infrared 
 mobile phone signals 
 a huge amount of um 
 of targeting that's done on individuals 
 is actually done at mobile phones as 
 opposed to that you're not looking at 
 the identity of the person you're 
 looking at 
 what phone are they carrying and we're 
 assuming that that tracks 
 radiation so enemy radar 
 sound 
 so for example that's detecting the 
 origin of someone shooting at you 
 um other signals so there's a thing 
 called iff beacons that's uh 
 identification friend or foe 
 and it basically tells you is this 
 aircraft or or ship or whatever friendly 
 or enemy 
 you could get data from other devices so 
 you could have like peer-to-peer 
 networks of these things sharing 
 information 
 and cameras for vision 
 that's probably not an exclusive list 
 but i think that covers kind of most of 
 the bases 
 so 
 the first example of autonomous weapons 
 that people tend to talk about are 
 guided missiles 
 and sensor fused weapons 
 so what these do is they use radar 
 infrared or some other means 
 to track a target but the target is 
 first selected by a human being so i 
 would say okay 
 that ship over there 
 we're going to attack that 
 and your guided missile will lock onto 
 it 
 so the decision is made by a human being 
 and it's pretty close in time to to when 
 when the actual strike happens so 
 typically you know when you target it 
 and you fire and the attack starts right 
 away 
 and the targets are typically military 
 targets so tanks ships that sort of 
 thing 
 these are not typically things that you 
 would use to attack 
 what we call dual use targets so 
 um that's 
 people 
 buildings that are not exclusively 
 military bases that sort of thing so 
 that's not typically what you're doing 
 with your guided missiles they're they 
 tend to be pretty pretty military 
 focused 
 and they use the sensor data only to 
 control the very end stage of the attack 
 usually so they pretty much fly towards 
 the thing you pointed them at and then 
 they use their their radar their 
 infrared to basically stay locked on 
 just in the final phase so they don't 
 sort of veer off 
 so a lot of people say oh well 
 autonomous weapon systems they will make 
 they will make warfare more precise 
 and they will help commanders to you 
 know carry out their intentions more 
 precisely 
 and every time i've looked at it 
 the americans are the one the ones that 
 say this a lot in the international 
 debates 
 every time i look at it 
 what they're talking about tends to be 
 stuff like this 
 um which as i say are not really 
 autonomous weapons in the sort of fully 
 autonomous sense of the word 
 so here's the second thing that some 
 people talk about when they say 
 autonomous weapons are great 
 so you've got missile defense shields or 
 counter rocket um 
 rocket and mortar 
 sea rams 
 and these are interesting as well 
 because 
 they're typically guarding a 
 human-occupied position so you use them 
 on a base or on a ship or somewhere 
 where people are 
 they don't move around by themselves 
 um they can be mounted on a vehicle 
 which can be moved 
 and what they do is they they typically 
 have more than one mode they may have 
 like a sort of a 
 manually 
 operated mode where they they're 
 watching for potential attacks and they 
 require a human being to sort of push a 
 button and say yep that's an attack far 
 back 
 or if you're expecting a big a big swarm 
 of incoming missiles or these days 
 drones or whatever you can put them into 
 a fully autonomous mode 
 and they will attack whatever they see 
 incoming but that's not typically how 
 they're operated most of the time 
 and they work based on radar mostly and 
 thermal imaging and the targets are 
 generally military in nature so these 
 are designed purely to attack missiles 
 and mortars and things like that coming 
 in 
 however 
 even with these systems which 
 are co-located with humans don't move 
 around and are pretty much targeted at 
 military things like missiles 
 um you have there have been accidents 
 that have occurred 
 particularly around aircraft serving a 
 couple of cases of missile defense 
 installations attacking aircraft both 
 military and civilian 
 um so 
 even this is not foolproof 
 then another thing that's coming out is 
 smart tanks and armored personnel 
 carriers or apcs so those again are 
 often manned vehicles but they can be 
 completely autonomous and completely 
 remotely operated 
 and these increasingly have the ability 
 to detect 
 threats which can be incoming fire but 
 here's the thing i went to an arms fair 
 last september and i went and i talked 
 to a bunch of these tank manufacturers 
 and what they do now is 
 they let you install your own software 
 plugin 
 that defines what a threat is 
 so you write a little plug-in that could 
 be anything like you could decide that 
 all human beings are threats or dogs or 
 threats or anytime you you know detect 
 the word hospital in a building it's a 
 threat you can do whatever you want um 
 crazy things 
 so that's a really interesting 
 development here i think that may be the 
 way that 
 manufacturers are going to go with this 
 they're going to build these very 
 flexible systems and let each military 
 sort of define what it is they're going 
 to do with them right 
 but here is the thing that really really 
 really tends to have people 
 worried 
 and these are loitering munitions 
 so loitering munition is sort of a cross 
 between a missile and a drone 
 so what they're designed to do is 
 basically fly around for a lengthy 
 period of time multiple hours 
 and sort of fly around in an area 
 and what they do is they look for 
 potential targets 
 and then they can attack 
 so you can define obviously it's 
 software so you can have any sorts of 
 behavior you want you can 
 you can you can um 
 you can build loitering munitions that 
 will always ask for human validation 
 before an attack 
 um and your targets and your targeting 
 criteria can vary really widely 
 and this is of course one of the 
 challenges in the debate about 
 autonomous weapons because an autonomous 
 weapon can be such a broad pass of 
 things right and the the the shape and 
 the scope of autonomy can vary a lot 
 but the key thing i think about the 
 loitering munition is 
 there's much less human sort of 
 awareness and much less human control 
 here because this thing is moving around 
 you know you deploy this to 
 sort of patrol an area which is going to 
 be multiple square miles potentially 
 you don't know where and when 
 that's going to attack 
 it's extremely difficult as a military 
 commander to say i'm going to deploy 
 this weapon in this area and it's going 
 to attack this sort of class of object 
 you can't predict what it's going to do 
 exactly 
 and 
 unless you have a really really good 
 awareness of what's in that area 
 um there's a huge potential for things 
 to go wrong here and i'll explain why in 
 a bit 
 so here's a concrete example of a um a 
 loitering munition this is a thing 
 called the harpy or the harop and it's 
 made by an israeli arms company called 
 iai 
 what it's designed to do is it flies 
 around it looks for military radar 
 signals 
 in a particular area and it can attack 
 them autonomously or semi-autonomously 
 with human supervision the idea here is 
 basically find your enemies 
 anti-aircraft installations and attack 
 them and take them out 
 this is exclusively attacking military 
 targets not dual use just the scope for 
 accident here and there is some risk 
 but 
 the sensor processing is really 
 straightforward there's a little bit 
 less that can go wrong here so it's not 
 the riskiest of autonomous weapons 
 this thing came out about two years ago 
 three years ago 
 this is the stm cargo 2 
 and this is made by the turkish weapons 
 company stm it's the state um weapons 
 company 
 so they boast about the awesome machine 
 vision software that they have here 
 including facial recognition 
 um the implied use case here is to be a 
 hunter killer robot that hunts and kills 
 human beings 
 and in fact two years ago in libya it is 
 claimed that these these um weapons were 
 actually used just for that 
 they were basically 
 pointed at a group of people who were 
 presumed to be fighters and 
 essentially kill them all 
 right 
 so 
 there's a huge ethical debate 
 around targeted killing and around 
 whether or not that's an okay way of 
 waging war and an okay way of carrying 
 out 
 counter-terrorism activities in 
 particular and we could easily talk for 
 more than 45 minutes just about that 
 but if we bypass all that entirely 
 there's a big technical concern here 
 because when you're talking about 
 machine vision in this context 
 you are talking about uncooperative 
 facial recognition in video 
 and that is not really reliable 
 the us institute national institute for 
 standards and technologies they have a 
 long-running series of evaluations they 
 do 
 on many different kinds of facial 
 recognition tools 
 and 
 in their last assessment of facial 
 recognition or uncooperative facial 
 recognition in video 
 their conclusion is essentially 
 it is not good enough for anything 
 important without human supervision 
 so building this sort of thing into a 
 killer drone is maybe a bit concerning 
 so this guy here is a thing called the 
 orlan 10 
 lira system 
 so the 
 orlan 10 is the drone and the lear is a 
 base station that sort of you know feeds 
 them 
 does control stuff and feed some 
 information 
 and what orland 10 does is it flies 
 around and it senses mobile phone 
 signals 
 so there is a system called skynet that 
 i don't know if some of you have heard 
 of um and i'm not that skynet no we're 
 not we're not back to the terminators 
 um skynet is a real computer system 
 that was used by the us 
 to attempt to 
 distinguish terrorists 
 in pakistan 
 this was in the late naughties and early 
 2010s i believe 
 they 
 they basically sucked up 
 all of the call metadata and sms 
 metadata from that from the pakistani 
 phone networks 
 and they used it to try and build a 
 machine learning model of that would 
 determine who is the terrorist and who 
 is not here's the thing they trained 
 that model on five people 
 five 
 they had five examples that's crazy 
 um 
 this all came out by the way in the 
 snowden leaks there's quite a lot 
 written about it and it seems to be 
 pretty reliable 
 so this is the sort of the 
 the statistical basis 
 that people are are being targeted over 
 you know suck in all the phone network 
 data 
 you know 
 build a jerry 
 machine learning model based on five 
 examples 
 fly this sort of thing around and kill 
 people 
 okay so 
 i want to talk very briefly about 
 a thing called international 
 humanitarian law or ihl 
 so this is also known as sort of the law 
 of war 
 and basically the idea here is that 
 there's two sort of legal regimes that 
 can apply 
 and then at any one time 
 now sitting here in ireland we are not 
 in a state of war you know normal 
 national laws and normal sort of 
 human rights law applies to us and we 
 can't be summarily killed unless 
 maybe we're menacing somebody in some 
 very physical way very immediate way 
 we have policing 
 in a state of war 
 a different set of laws apply and 
 what they do is they provide certain 
 specific protections to civilians and 
 also to combatants so there's rules 
 around things like how you take care of 
 prisoners of war that kind of stuff 
 so it's based on just war theory which 
 kind of has this this this two-way split 
 just add bellum is basically how you 
 make the decision uh about whether or 
 not it's okay to go to war is this a 
 just war 
 am i defending myself or is am i 
 do i have another good reason to go to 
 war 
 and then just in bellow is all about the 
 conduct of warfare 
 now the two big ideas in jerusalem 
 bellow the conduct of war is that when 
 you're making an attack 
 you have to you have to apply a 
 principle called distinction and what 
 that says is 
 i have to attack military targets the 
 aim is to weaken military force 
 that's the only valid aim 
 you and that doesn't say that doesn't 
 mean that you can't make attacks where 
 you might do damage to civilians or 
 civilian stuff you can 
 um but you can't 
 aim to do that 
 so 
 military targets are basically military 
 objects your tanks your warships your 
 bases 
 and combatants who are taking direct 
 part in the conflict they don't have to 
 be in a military uniform 
 but there's complications 
 these are not straightforward criteria 
 so for example 
 there are some military forces of 
 military uniform that are not valid 
 targets that's people who are who are 
 wounded in combat 
 um you also can't target medics or um 
 chaplains 
 and 
 you can't target people who are 
 surrendering so there's actually a bunch 
 of exceptions here and when somebody 
 isn't wearing a military uniform it gets 
 even more complicated 
 um so this is something that was maybe 
 relatively easy you know back in 
 napoleonic times dude is you know 
 standing there with his bayonet and his 
 big red uniform on on a battlefield 
 okay 
 these days not so much 
 so proportionality is the second part of 
 this 
 so you say okay well i really really 
 need to attack this thing there are some 
 civilians nearby 
 is that okay 
 um so yes if you don't intend 
 to kill the civilians but you foresee 
 that you will you're actually allowed to 
 do that that's okay 
 but 
 you have to balance 
 what you intend to gain from this 
 militarily with the amount of civilian 
 harm that you foresee 
 so if you foresee that you would 
 kill a thousand civilians to take out a 
 very minor military objective that's 
 probably 
 not proportional 
 now 
 there's even more complication around 
 this so again since napoleonic times 
 you have to think about this as well in 
 terms of not only 
 one specific attack or engagement 
 we also kind of think about this in 
 terms of 
 like weapon development 
 is it possible for a particular weapon 
 to be used in 
 in compliance with these rules 
 so a lot of the objections to say land 
 mines come about because 
 landmines can't do distinction right 
 landmine just goes off no matter who 
 steps on it could be a kid could be a 
 soldier could be anyone right 
 then 
 rules of engagement are another thing as 
 well militaries have these things called 
 rules of engagement that are basically 
 sort of 
 playbooks for how they do war stuff 
 and depending on 
 what their current playbook says 
 soldiers and commanders will react in 
 different ways to different situations 
 so think about this you are a military 
 force and you are holding a city and you 
 have checkpoints around the place to 
 monitor what people are doing and where 
 they're going and make sure that the bad 
 guys aren't moving around your city 
 somebody drives up to your checkpoint 
 and doesn't stop 
 what you do then depends on what rules 
 of engagement apply 
 so distinction and proportionality they 
 sound kind of simple but they're 
 actually there's a huge amount of 
 context and nuance here 
 and that's really relevant when we think 
 about whether or not an autonomous 
 weapon is going to be able to 
 be used in compliance with these laws 
 and i don't say whether or not the 
 weapon will comply with the laws because 
 a weapon is is a machine and laws don't 
 apply to machines laws apply to people 
 so 
 but you know are they going to be able 
 to be used in compliance 
 so 
 whether or not they can be used in 
 compliance to me really comes down to 
 can they be predicted 
 um 
 i think the answer is 
 not in all cases 
 and you know this is risk so you know 
 risk is always a continue 
 so 
 to me 
 the more your target and a lot of people 
 agree with this is not just me the more 
 you're targeting dual use objects in 
 particular people 
 and buildings where where there may be 
 civilians present 
 and vehicles where there may be 
 civilians present the more you're 
 targeting dual use objects 
 and the further away you are 
 from that human decision to to to 
 dispatch a weapon or to make an attack 
 the more risk you have 
 of something happening 
 that the commander did not intend 
 and 
 i spent a lot of time in my career 
 building systems that 
 do little autonomous things you know i i 
 build software that runs software and 
 runs distributed systems and runs 
 hardware and this is something that i 
 have seen to be true 
 you know you you build a piece of 
 software and you game it out and you try 
 and figure out what it should do in all 
 cases and 
 it works for a while and then something 
 happens that some 
 quirk of the environment or things that 
 it interacts with that you didn't intend 
 and bam something happens 
 you know 
 a software system going down is one 
 thing but an attack happening is another 
 you know 
 downtime is bad 
 death is is 
 infinitely worse 
 so this is really what what it comes 
 down to to me 
 the way that um autonomous weapons are 
 developing 
 away from the the likes of the crams and 
 the guided missiles 
 where there is still that very direct 
 human control albeit with 
 some smart software stuff 
 moving towards 
 weapons that move around 
 that that are more likely to attack 
 humans and other dual use things are far 
 more risky 
 and they're risky in a way that i don't 
 think militaries necessarily appreciate 
 because they haven't used these kinds of 
 software before 
 and where they have i mean they often 
 have 
 had accidents 
 but there's this this notion and it's i 
 mean we live in an age of 
 artificial intelligence and machine 
 learning hype 
 and it's it's justifiable in some ways 
 because yes it's gotten amazing and 
 there are so many 
 low stakes and you know low risk tasks 
 where machine learning is a great answer 
 but there are there are areas where it's 
 not 
 so when we think about it ai is 
 sort of i mean this is 
 all of these definitions are fuzzy but 
 broadly speaking ai is around decision 
 making and reasoning 
 optimization playing games finding 
 routes 
 these are are great applications because 
 you can you can fully game out a game 
 you can simulate it repeatedly and train 
 your system 
 um so you can do these large searches of 
 potential solution spaces and you end up 
 with things that seem magical 
 but these things don't apply to the real 
 world because i cannot simulate the real 
 world repeatedly in perfect detail 
 so this i i think that the myth of the 
 ai super strategist weapon is is just 
 wrong right 
 but then we have machine learning which 
 is the 
 automated analysis of data based on 
 statistical analysis of data sets so 
 machine vision categorization 
 identification 
 this is you know the cargo and the sky 
 net that we talked about earlier 
 and here's how they would fit into into 
 weapons right 
 so an autonomous weapon roughly has this 
 kind of logical structure you've got 
 some sensor data coming in 
 you got some configuration so what area 
 should i patrol what sort of targets am 
 i looking for that kind of thing 
 we process the sensor data that's prob 
 very possibly some sort of machine 
 learning thing that is going to attempt 
 to take that sensor data 
 and turn it into something that your 
 decision making part of your software 
 can work with 
 so here you've got your autonomous 
 weapons systems logic and yes i know 
 that the collision with um amazon web 
 services is unfortunate but it is what 
 it is 
 um 
 so 
 your your your aws logic is gonna see 
 okay have i got a valid target 
 what are my goals does targeting this 
 target sort of meet those goals what are 
 my constraints have i met my constraints 
 so all this kind of decision making 
 stuff that we have and based on that 
 you're gonna have your next action which 
 is going to be 
 attack or you know continue your 
 continue your patrol looking for for 
 more targets right 
 so if you've got the harpy the this is 
 the anti-radiation missile that we 
 looked at 
 um it's going to look something like 
 this there isn't really a lot of kind of 
 air machine learning special source in 
 here this is fairly predictable stuff 
 so you don't have a lot of like 
 non-explainable black boxes here 
 and that doesn't mean there is a 
 potential to go wrong because there is 
 uh we could misidentify signals and we 
 could you know decide that this super 
 powerful wi-fi router is a real military 
 radar and take out a school that kind of 
 thing but there isn't sort of machine 
 learning black boxes and the critical 
 thing here is we've sort of solved the 
 proportionality and distinction target 
 by our problems by saying 
 okay all military radar is a valid 
 target and it's in scope so this is the 
 benefit of not 
 building these systems to attack these 
 very 
 very gray area kind of dual use 
 targets 
 but an autonomous weapon that is 
 designed to say target 
 people or or dual use weapons has it has 
 a lot likely has a lot more of this kind 
 of machine learning special source in 
 right 
 so again your sensor data could be phone 
 signals and camera if it's if it's the 
 cargo 
 um can i process the sensor data have i 
 have i matched a target 
 you know now you've got to start 
 computing probability of you know is it 
 who you think it is compute the risk of 
 is it an imminent thresh 
 so 
 a lot of the time you can only target 
 people if they're considered to be an 
 imminent threat or at least according to 
 a lot of countries who do target people 
 as individuals 
 and check proportionality so how many 
 people do i think will be affected if i 
 make this attack 
 so all of these things very gray area 
 a lot of risk of getting it wrong 
 so just to sort of talk a little bit 
 about the philosophy of 
 kind of ai and machine learning 
 a lot of people say okay well 
 there's going to be progress here 
 ai machine learning it's going to get 
 smart enough that 
 these systems will be really well able 
 to carry out the intent of the commander 
 the problem here is 
 that means they have to be basically as 
 smart as the commander 
 that means this is essentially 
 equivalent to saying that there has to 
 be artificial general intelligence here 
 a lot of people think that that's not 
 going to happen 
 so here's at least not with the ways 
 that we're currently approaching it 
 so here's herbert wrote a very good book 
 on this 
 he basically says this stuff is great 
 when you have 
 you know 
 fairly well structured problems 
 but it is not good on less structured 
 problems 
 if you read any of the books on military 
 targeting particularly around dual use 
 subjects 
 and they will tell you that it's 
 extremely difficult and extremely gray 
 area they do not have a defined process 
 for doing this they will tell you that 
 they have criteria and a whole process 
 but there's a lot of judgment involved 
 inevitably when we get into these 
 complicated systems there's going to be 
 machine learning perception involved so 
 whether it's 
 machine vision or other other types of 
 things 
 now we're contending with all sorts of 
 things if you have a combat battlefield 
 you have weather variations you have 
 smoke you have a lot of stuff going on 
 and you have potential for adversarial 
 attacks you know people have you know 
 long figured out how to 
 change uh road signs so that uh 
 autonomous vehicles will be fooled 
 even very basic things like tracking an 
 object that goes behind something else 
 is still quite a challenge 
 in machine learning 
 and is well known that trying to use an 
 ml based system in conditions other than 
 what it was trained in 
 yields unpredictable results 
 now the problem with a weapon is that 
 you know your battlefield could be 
 anywhere in the world any time of the 
 year any weather conditions 
 any sorts of human behavior um 
 you know the environment is just very 
 incredibly wildly 
 even if i went out and i trained my my 
 machine learning weapon in a particular 
 place 
 now 
 doesn't mean that the same conditions 
 are going to apply next december if i uh 
 if i deploy that weapon there and i 
 think that's a huge and 
 it's a huge problem i think it's a 
 bigger problem than militaries think it 
 is 
 um 
 and i often look at the the progress in 
 autonomous driving as a sort of a 
 guideline to this i mean the amount of 
 money and engineering um 
 the amount of money and engineering time 
 that's been poured into that and there 
 are still quite a lot of problems with 
 it and there will never be nearly so 
 much um 
 money and engineering time put into 
 autonomous weapons so i think 
 there are problems there 
 eric j larson um he basically you wrote 
 a book called the myth of artificial 
 intelligence why computers can't think 
 the way we do and basically he says that 
 machine learning is a form of induction 
 um 
 bertrand russell talked about the thing 
 called the inductivist turkey 
 who thinks that every morning the farmer 
 comes out and feeds him and he does up 
 until christmas eve morning when he 
 kills the turkey the turkey is surprised 
 because the turkey doesn't know 
 it doesn't understand the world doesn't 
 try to sort of 
 model it 
 the way a human being would and that 
 doesn't mean that we can't be surprised 
 but we do have more capacity to actually 
 understand the way the world works and 
 to predict it 
 a great example of that was this 
 gentleman here and this is stanislav 
 petrov um 
 anyone else who was alive in 1983 he may 
 have saved your life 
 and in fact all of us um 
 because he was on duty in a soviet 
 nuclear missile bunker 
 and he had an automated alert come in 
 that said the us has launched five 
 missiles and he said 
 no well i mean his job at this point was 
 basically say okay yep deploy a 
 counterattack that was his job and he 
 didn't do it he instead said 
 there is no way that if the us is 
 attacking us they have sent just five 
 missiles this is probably wrong 
 and so he declined to fire those 
 missiles and pretty much saved the world 
 now would a computer have been able to 
 reason through that sort of problem 
 there's a proposal that we could build 
 autonomous weapons with an ethical 
 governor and this is the sort of the 
 metaphor for the governor on the steam 
 engine back in the the days of newton 
 and watts 
 it basically stops it exploding 
 and the problem with this metaphor 
 is that 
 when you're talking about a weapon 
 system the operator wants the weapon to 
 make attacks 
 the the operator of a steam engine does 
 not want their steam engine to explode 
 the the the incentives are not aligned 
 there's also a bunch of other stuff 
 there's a thing called the frame problem 
 which basically is the problem deciding 
 what is relevant to any given decision 
 it turns out that we are pretty good at 
 this and we're pretty much built to 
 solve the frame problem um computers we 
 have not figured it out yet 
 and 
 any real ethical governor 
 um and this has never been built that 
 they've only been proposed with like a 
 toy solution 
 any real ethical governor would have to 
 solve a huge amount of very complex 
 stuff and if we did it based on on rules 
 there's a phenomenon called rules 
 explosion where once you get past a 
 certain amount of rules in a rules 
 engine based system it becomes 
 unmaintainable because the rules 
 interact in you know unpredictable 
 complex ways 
 putting a human in the loop can't solve 
 the problem first off 
 militaries want 
 to use these systems in places where 
 they don't have communications so human 
 control is unfeasible 
 and then there's a problem called 
 automation bias 
 this basically means that anywhere where 
 we try to automate part of a task and 
 sort of have humans supervise the robots 
 and we've always to date failed 
 um because human beings are bad at this 
 if if the 
 if the automated system is doing a 
 pretty decent job we tend to just sort 
 of zone out and let it do the thing and 
 this is exactly why people keep driving 
 their teslas into the back of trucks 
 you know we risk 
 we risk just people becoming bush and 
 button pushers and that's not effective 
 supervision 
 stock market flash crash is caused by 
 trading bots 
 this is a phenomenon based on sort of 
 emergent behavior in complex systems 
 where you have multiple things 
 interacting 
 if we have autonomous weapons 
 interacting with the world with each 
 other with people 
 that is a complex system 
 we risk flash wars 
 because in a context if one weapon is 
 going to decide to attack incorrectly 
 probably any weapon all weapons that you 
 have in that area will decide to to do 
 that 
 in a stock market we can put in circuit 
 breakers to suspend trading when we see 
 a flash crash 
 in a communication jammed battlefield 
 there is no way to do that 
 there is no circuit breaker for the real 
 world 
 there's no feedback loop or no effective 
 feedback loop for autonomous weapons 
 if you're aws or google you don't deploy 
 these things with no feedback 
 but militaries are very bad at getting 
 feedback on how their weapons are 
 performing 
 so i'm out of time so i'm just going to 
 skip over this i'm going to say 
 robot wars 
 autonomous weapons don't mean robot wars 
 with no human suffering it's not this 
 it's robots attacking people and 
 critical infrastructure like water 
 plants and electricity plants that have 
 a dramatic impact on human lives 
 if i've convinced you here is a place 
 where you can go to take action thank 
 you very much 
 thanks laura 
 i hope you enjoy that so we 
 are at 
 store still in time so what i'm gonna do 
 is i'm gonna 
 we're gonna have q a now that's okay 
 there's only a few minutes oh do we have 
 any remote 
 no 
 okay so if anyone have any questions 
 please come up to the mic 
 and um 
 you can have the floor and or a 
 question 
 yep 
 now if we refrain from developing this 
 technology will not dictators 
 uh do it 
 and have an advantage and how would we 
 solve that problem 
 that's an excellent question 
 so um 
 if we refrain from developing this 
 technology and dictators develop it um 
 well first off 
 i think it is better for the world if we 
 do not have the big arms manufacturers 
 developing 
 off-the-shelf 
 highly capable autonomous weapons 
 it's going to be very very difficult to 
 stop somebody developing small 
 jury-rigged autonomous weapons 
 absolutely 
 but that doesn't mean that we can't stop 
 the big arms manufacturers building them 
 and selling them 
 then secondly i think bringing in a 
 legal prohibition 
 also acts as a sort of a a moral break 
 on it like if we can build a moral 
 consensus against this 
 most dictators and not all do not use 
 things like chemical weapons 
 um and most and you know there are many 
 several regimes in the world that have 
 nuclear weapons and they haven't been 
 used for the last 80 years 
 and those are largely because there is a 
 strong moral consensus that these things 
 are bad 
 nothing is perfect um 
 we don't make laws because we think 
 they'll never be broken all laws are 
 broken sometimes 
 um 
 it's not perfect 
 but i think um 
 bringing an international law that says 
 is you know actually an international 
 consensus against this 
 it will at least deter dictators 
 so 
 okay i think we have um we should have 
 time for one more let's try one more and 
 see how you get on with the answer 
 okay um thank you for an amazing talk 
 that was really great very stimulating 
 um 
 you mentioned that you were asked to 
 talk more about technology than 
 philosophy i have a background in 
 philosophy as well and my heart kind of 
 sank when you said that because i sort 
 of think you know we should all 
 be thinking about these sorts of things 
 in philosophy i know i know vicky but 
 i'd be interested to know what would you 
 suggest to a group of programmers who 
 might not be familiar with the field of 
 philosophy and ethics where should they 
 start you mentioned the good place which 
 is awesome what else should they watch 
 or read 
 what else 
 that's a great question um 
 so in terms of 
 war ethics um the 
 the um there are some there's there's a 
 really good book on just war ethics um 
 suggest reading that i guess although 
 just war ethics is not perfect 
 um it's a place to start 
 um 
 there are a lot of um 
 there are a lot of sort of intro 
 ethics-y texts that will tell you but 
 like the difference between 
 utilitarianism and 
 you know um 
 other different 
 like virtue ethics all this kind of 
 stuff um i have never found one that was 
 kind of super engaging um so i think my 
 recommendation remains a good place 
 sadly enough 
 thanks laura um so 
 and thanks nicholas so i think that's um 
 the end of this 
 session we have coffee right now coffee 
 break it's 10 o'clock according to my 
 phone yes it is 10 o'clock 
 and 
 so thank you again and thank you laura

 uh we're here 
 at microsoft and we have been sponsoring 
 era python for i believe four years now 
 it's been some time and we're excited to 
 be back here this year yeah so for euro 
 python this year um our team has a few 
 talks uh lined up for some of the 
 attendees so we're doing that and we 
 also have some cool swag and stickers 
 for all the attendees as well some of 
 them might be limited edition we'll see 
 and we absolutely love europe python 
 because of the community the european 
 community is amazing and we love being 
 able to see them in hearing person get 
 this just this connection that we nor we 
 can't have virtually but it's always not 
 the same in person it's always like that 
 really great conversations and we get 
 like um 
 great feedback from our users as well 
 but most importantly it's the 
 conversations about how much we love 
 python all the amazing things we do 
 with this like the european 
 community 
 so we're a brand new sponsor for for 
 european this year bank of america 
 mainly here as a recruitment drive we 
 have you know plenty of open roads in 
 the python space 
 both in core app development django 
 flask and 
 uh and across full stack as well 
 in terms of doing something special for 
 the attendees we have a really 
 interesting speaker this year in terms 
 of niall o'connor talking about asset 
 price reversals um 
 without the normal swag and uh special 
 gifts for people and we'll be doing some 
 some raffles and giveaways um and if 
 there's anyone who wants to talk to us 
 at the desk we're here all through the 
 conference i guess we chose europe 
 because a it's in dublin and it's the 
 first time since uh be covered times 
 i've been able to get people together 
 and really you know promote what we do 
 in in bank america in terms of python um 
 you know it's a very much a python 
 focused 
 conference which is really where our 
 tech stack lies and where a lot of our 
 projects are within bank of america 
 so hi my name is marianne shine and i'm 
 the head of hr and operations with 
 umnitza in ireland 
 so this is umnitz's first year to 
 sponsor european we're so excited to 
 celebrate this year and participate in 
 euro python 
 coming to ireland so um 
 is a u.s company with our r d based in 
 galway in the west of ireland we have 
 employees all over ireland and we 
 thought this would be a great 
 opportunity to bring them along today 
 and participate in the ecosystem the 
 python ecosystem and really learn from 
 other professionals within this area 
 this year we're actually sponsoring the 
 pi ladies lunch so nitsa are very 
 passionate about gender diversity within 
 our engineering team in galway we 
 currently have 33 
 um females in our team and so we're very 
 privileged and honored to sponsor the 
 pie ladies lunch which i think is taking 
 place on friday so we're very excited to 
 be here i think europe python is a very 
 unique conference 
 and because i think it 
 brings people who are passionate about 
 python together 
 and really gives them the opportunity to 
 learn about the most progressive 
 practices within python and also 
 leverage the wider 
 python ecosystem

 the 
 in my team execution research everything 
 starts from data 
 after getting the data we do our 
 research and analysis on this data to 
 test our ideas 
 and then finally we have to get it in an 
 output format such that trading or 
 trading strategies can pick this up and 
 this whole workflow almost exclusively 
 works in python 
 working in a company that has 
 aspirations to be the best at what they 
 do that's what drives people solving 
 problems and having the best people with 
 you trying to solve those problems you 
 can't beat that 
 there are people who are actually able 
 to not only look at the data and 
 understand it but analyze it and express 
 it in a way that others understand 
 and that's i suppose that's the gift of 
 a great storyteller

 bank america in terms of python um 
 you know it's a very much 
 a python focused uh conference which is 
 really where our tech stack lies and 
 where a lot of our projects are within 
 bank of america 
 so hi my name is marianne shine and i'm 
 the head of hr and operations with 
 umnitza in ireland 
 so this is umnitz's first year to 
 sponsor your python we're so excited to 
 celebrate this year and participate in 
 europe python 
 coming to ireland so umnitsa is a u.s 
 company with our r d based in galway in 
 the west of ireland we have employees 
 all over ireland and we thought this 
 would be a great opportunity to bring 
 them along today and participate 
 in the ecosystem the python ecosystem 
 and really learn from 
 other professionals within this area 
 this year we're actually sponsoring the 
 pi ladies lunch so nitza are very 
 passionate about gender diversity within 
 our engineering team in galway we 
 currently have 33 
 females in our team 
 and so we're very privileged and honored 
 to sponsor the pie ladies lunch which i 
 think is taking place on friday so we're 
 very excited to be here i think europe 
 python is a very unique conference 
 and because i think it 
 brings people who are passionate about 
 python together and really gives them 
 the opportunity to learn about the most 
 progressive practices within python and 
 also leverage the wider 
 python ecosystem

 so in my team execution research 
 everything starts from data 
 after getting the data we do our 
 research and analysis on this data to 
 test our ideas 
 and then finally we have to get it in an 
 output format such that trading or 
 trading strategies can pick this up and 
 this whole workflow almost exclusively 
 works in python 
 working in a company that has 
 aspirations to be the best at what they 
 do that's what drives people solving 
 problems and having the best people with 
 you trying to solve those problems you 
 can't beat that 
 there are people who are actually able 
 to not only look at the data and 
 understand it but analyze it and express 
 it in a way that others understand 
 and that's i suppose that's the gift of 
 a great storyteller

 [Music] 
 uh we're here 
 at microsoft and we have been sponsoring 
 era python for i believe four years now 
 it's been some time and we're excited to 
 be back here this year yeah so for euro 
 python this year 
 our team has a few talks uh lined up for 
 some of the attendees so we're doing 
 that and we also have some cool swag and 
 stickers for all the attendees as well 
 some of them might be limited edition 
 we'll see 
 we absolutely love europa python because 
 of the community uh the european 
 community is amazing and we love being 
 able to see them in hearing person get 
 this just this connection that we nor we 
 can't have virtually but it's always not 
 the same in person it's always like that 
 really great conversations and we get 
 like 
 great feedback from our users as well 
 but most importantly it's the 
 conversations about how much we love 
 python all the amazing things we do 
 with this like the european uh community 
 so we're a brand new sponsor for uh for 
 euro python this year bank of america 
 mainly here as a recruitment drive we 
 have you know plenty of open roles in 
 the python space 
 both in core app development django 
 flask and 
 uh and across full stack as well 
 in terms of doing something special for 
 the attendees we have a really 
 interesting speaker this year in terms 
 of night o'connor talking about asset 
 price reversals 
 we'll have the normal swag and 
 special gifts for people and we'll be 
 doing some some raffles and giveaways 
 and if there's anyone who wants to talk 
 to us at the desk we're here all through 
 the conference guess we chose european 
 because a it's in dublin and it's the 
 first time since uh be covered times 
 i've been able to get people together 
 and really you know promote what we do

 good morning everyone and welcome to the 
 second day of euro python talks here in 
 the auditorium and i'd also like to 
 issue a special welcome to the people 
 watching us on venulis to the remote 
 participants 
 um just a reminder just uh like people 
 in the auditorium can ask questions 
 later the remote people are also invited 
 to ask questions on venulis and be put 
 on stage 
 now let's welcome our first speaker 
 sebastian vitovsky 
 he's a python consultant from poland and 
 he's going to present ways to write 
 faster python 
 please give a 
 full round of applause to sebastian 
 thank you very much martin 
 hi i'm super excited to be here because 
 this topic and this conference has a 
 special place in my heart 
 writing faster python was my first talk 
 that i ever did at the conference and i 
 presented it in 
 europe item in bilbao in 2016. 
 but many things has changed since that 
 time so i decided it's time to update 
 that talk 
 python 2 is no longer a thing we have 
 like new interpreters popping up 
 we also have some very interesting 
 initiatives aiming at speeding up the c 
 python 
 but one thing has not changed 
 whenever there is an internet discussion 
 and two words appear together python and 
 performance there is always someone 
 saying don't use python python is slow 
 python is not slow python is slower than 
 some other languages and quite often 
 that's fine 
 i mean 
 python was not optimized for the speed 
 python was optimized for the development 
 speed and comparing the number of people 
 writing code in assembly to the number 
 of python programmers 
 i think it was a good decision 
 but but why is python slower 
 well one of the reasons that makes 
 python slower than some other languages 
 is also the reason why 
 it's so easy to use python 
 python is a dynamic language and 
 that combined with the weekly typing 
 means that we can use the famous duck 
 typing and we don't have to worry too 
 much about the types of our variables 
 so 
 nothing stops you from randomly 
 reassigning variables throughout your 
 code 
 okay technically your sanity should stop 
 you from doing that but i mean you can 
 assign a variable to a string then 
 reassign it to an integer to a list to a 
 pandas data frame and so on 
 and the interpreter has no way to know 
 in advance what's the type of a given 
 variable so it can't do any of those 
 optimizations that the statically typed 
 languages can do 
 for him your variables are always a 
 mystery sure you declared a string but 
 what's it gonna be 500 lines of code 
 later 
 still a string 
 you don't know so the trill of being a c 
 python interpreter must be crazy 
 um i don't have time to go into more 
 details why python is slower 
 but if you're interested there's this 
 really nice talk by anthony show given 
 at spike on a few years ago so you can 
 find it on youtube 
 so what can we do with the fact that 
 python is slower than other languages 
 well 
 i probably don't have to tell that in a 
 room full of developers but i work in 
 various companies and i'm still 
 surprised how many of them will pay a 
 ridiculous amount of money to the 
 developer only to make them work on some 
 old laptop that was just lying around 
 i mean look 
 if this is your computer then i'm sorry 
 to break it to you but python is not 
 your bottleneck 
 and even if you're hopefully not running 
 your python programs on a potato 
 if you need to run some large 
 computations just rent a server in a 
 cloud 
 i did a quick quick check and for 54 
 bucks per hour you get a vm with six 
 terabytes of memory 
 and even if you don't need such a 
 ludicrous amount of memory and let's say 
 just 128 gigabytes is fine that's like 
 one dollar per hour and we are still 
 looking at a quite expensive 
 cloud computing provider and on-demand 
 pricing so we can find much better deals 
 so instead of wasting a whole day just 
 to implement some crazy algorithm to 
 process your data in chunks because they 
 don't fit into your memory just spend a 
 few bucks and run your computations on a 
 computer that can fit all the data into 
 memory 
 you can also use a different interpreter 
 when i say python i actually mean c 
 python implementation but there are 
 other implementations out there 
 and i know this is an advice that is 
 everyone gives this advice but very few 
 people takes it but the ecosystem of 
 python interpreters is constantly 
 changing 
 wi-fi is now 
 much more compatible with c python code 
 than it was six years ago when i was 
 talking about writing faster python for 
 the first time 
 if you have some code that does a lot of 
 math in loops then piper will probably 
 run your code a few times faster 
 and even though it might not improve the 
 speed of your c extensions at least it 
 can run them which was a major concern 
 back in the past 
 and there are of course other other 
 interpreters there is pi stone developed 
 by anaconda there is cinder used by 
 instagram there is pygeon growl python 
 and so on 
 one thing that makes python so great and 
 so popular in the data science community 
 is that python is a perfect glue 
 language it means that you can use 
 python to orchestrate some libraries 
 that were written in a much more 
 performant languages 
 so you can use numpy which has very 
 efficient data structures and scientific 
 functions 
 you can for example use also number that 
 has a just in time compiler that you can 
 apply with a simple decorator and again 
 you will get some really nice speed ups 
 on math operations and loops 
 yet another way to squeeze those few 
 percent of speed up with almost no cost 
 is to update your python version 
 with each new release various parts of 
 code gets improved so if you suddenly 
 jump from python 3.6 to 3.11 it might 
 turn out that your code is not is much 
 faster right now 
 and even though 
 switching between let's say python 3.9 
 and 3.10 is not as problematic as moving 
 from python 2 to python 3. 
 you still need to have a good test suit 
 to make sure that everything works fine 
 but if you do have a good test suit then 
 upgrading your python version is 
 basically a free speed up 
 and finally you can write faster python 
 by using better algorithms and data 
 structures and that's an advice that 
 applies pretty much to any programming 
 language let me show you an example 
 so 
 does my magic stick works 
 welcome 
 yes i get it here okay 
 so 
 let's say i want to compute the sum of 
 powers of the first 1 million numbers so 
 i can define a total variable and then 
 run a function that will just go through 
 all the numbers and add their powers to 
 the total variable and then at the end i 
 just print this total variable 
 now i want to check how long it takes to 
 execute this function i can use ipython 
 and two of its magic commands 
 i can use run to run a script and then 
 time to measure the execution time of 
 the previous command 
 and this method of measurement is far 
 from perfect and in the later examples i 
 will use something much more reliable 
 but this is a simple example i just want 
 to have the most simple way to give me 
 some number so please bear with me 
 and if you have no idea what ipython is 
 it's a much better python 
 interactive shell i gave a talk about it 
 three years ago so if you're interested 
 you can find it on youtube 
 but back to our example so 
 i'm running my code and i can see that 
 it takes 72 milliseconds 
 i'm using the wall time which means that 
 i start the timer i run the code i stop 
 the timer and i return the difference 
 between start and stop nothing too fancy 
 but it gives us a number 
 obviously there is a lot to improve here 
 so let's start small by moving the total 
 variable inside of our function 
 so we got rid of the global variable and 
 we are down from 72 milliseconds to 63. 
 that's like a decent 
 15 of speed up by simply eliminating the 
 need to modify the global variable 
 global variables not only make your code 
 harder to read and reason about because 
 you have to search where they are 
 defined but also what other code 
 modifies them they also make your code 
 slower because looking up global 
 variables takes time 
 but we can do even better let's use the 
 build in sum function to actually add 
 the numbers to make this work we will 
 have to switch from a for loop to a list 
 comprehension cool our code got much 
 simpler and we are down to 59 
 milliseconds so another few percent of 
 speedup improvement 
 we can do one more improvement at this 
 point we can replace the least 
 comprehension with a generator 
 expression 
 and to do that we just have to remove 
 the square brackets and 
 now our code is slower is it bad well 
 that depends 
 optimization is often a trade-off 
 between the speed and memory usage 
 generator expression has disadvantage 
 over the list comprehension that 
 it uses much less memory because it does 
 the computation when it's needed list 
 comprehension will generate you the 
 whole list at once and it will use much 
 more memory 
 so for a very large list you might 
 actually want to use a code that is a 
 bit slower but it won't eat up all your 
 ram 
 we can actually check this with ipython 
 and the memory profiler 
 so here you can see that the list 
 list comprehension version increased the 
 memory usage by 50 mb bytes and the 
 generator expression had almost no 
 impact on the memory usage 
 so as i said optimization is often a 
 trade-off between the speed and the 
 memory usage 
 alternatively if we can't turn our for 
 loop into a nice least comprehension 
 combined with a built-in function there 
 is another trick that we can use 
 there is a library called number that is 
 basically a jit compiler packed as a 
 python package so 
 we can install it with pip install 
 number 
 and we can just add this small decorator 
 here 
 and as you can see 
 we just cut the execution time by half 
 with literally two lines of no-brainers 
 code 
 and of course number can only improve 
 some specific code so like loops and 
 math operations 
 if we try to use it some on some other 
 code it might not improve it 
 but i mean it's very easy to to use it 
 so 
 it's it's a nice tool to test 
 but we can do even better 
 let's go back to the version with the 
 list comprehension so 
 python lists are heterogeneous it means 
 that they can store different types of 
 values together but in our example we 
 are operating on integers and there is a 
 library that it's much faster for 
 working with numbers 
 as probably most of you can guess it's 
 numpy 
 so numpy is packed with functions and 
 data structures optimized for working 
 with numbers so we can take advantage of 
 that 
 and we can create an array of integers 
 and then we can call the power and sum 
 functions from the numpy library 
 and if we try to run it it will improve 
 the execution time by two more 
 milliseconds compared to the least 
 comprehension 
 okay that's not much i mean it's almost 
 like 
 using numpy doesn't make any sense well 
 turns out that the problem is not with 
 numpy the problem is with my poor simple 
 benchmarking methodology 
 so when i run the benchmarks the second 
 time it now only takes 10 milliseconds 
 to execute this code 
 that's because my benchmarks are also 
 measuring the execution time of the 
 import statement and that's when i run 
 it the second time the import statement 
 is much faster 
 that's why i said that my benchmarking 
 method i'm using here is pretty terrible 
 and we will switch to something better 
 in a moment but just to sum up my 
 example as you can see we got down from 
 72 milliseconds to around 10. that's a 
 pretty decent improvement but the more 
 important thing is that we learn some 
 things on the way 
 we replace a global variable with a 
 local local one which not only makes 
 your code faster but also easier to 
 reason about 
 we switched to using the built-in 
 function instead of reinventing the 
 wheel you can find a lot of optimized 
 functions in the python standard library 
 especially in modules like ether tools 
 or collections 
 we used a list comprehension instead of 
 a for loop which is a much more 
 idiomatic way for creating the list and 
 if you're more concerned about the 
 memory usage of your 
 applications than the speed you can use 
 the generator expression instead 
 finally we reached out for numpy which 
 gives you python bindings for functions 
 and data structures implemented in c or 
 fortran so you can keep writing your 
 code in python and at the same time 
 benefit from those very fast languages 
 running your code 
 and we also saw how we can use a jit 
 compiler like number where 
 with just two lines of code we could get 
 a really good speed improvement on a 
 specific functions 
 so what we just saw was the source code 
 optimization that is writing your 
 programs in a way that will make them 
 run faster hopefully without sacrificing 
 the readability 
 so in the rest of this talk i want to 
 show you some more examples of two or 
 more ways to achieve the same results 
 for some common operations and then i 
 will run some benchmark 
 benchmarks and try to explain you why 
 one way might be better than the other 
 you can find all the code examples at 
 this url i will show this url at the end 
 so don't worry and here is the 
 better setup that i used for measuring 
 my code examples 
 i use python 
 3.10.4 which was the latest stable 
 version of python at the time of making 
 those slides 
 i set the python don't write bytecode 
 environment variable so i don't 
 accidentally cache any 
 byte code between my benchmarks 
 and for the actual execution i use a 
 fairly standard and simple way of 
 running time it in the terminal 
 so here is how it works the green part 
 tells 
 python to run the timing module which is 
 a built-in module for measuring the 
 execution time of some code 
 then the red part tells 
 run me this code but don't include it in 
 the benchmarks this will solve the 
 problem i had in the previous examples 
 where i was importing the numpy module 
 and the import statement actually took 
 most of 
 the benchmarks and finally in the yellow 
 i will have the function that i want to 
 benchmark 
 and not that it matters much but the 
 benchmarks has been run on this laptop 
 which is uh 
 macbook pro from 2021 16 gigs of ram 10 
 cpu cores 16 gpu cores 
 but it doesn't really matter which 
 laptop i'm using even with the same 
 setup you will probably get a different 
 number and that's fine i mean exact 
 numbers don't matter if i rerun the 
 benchmarks a couple of times sometimes 
 they will be slightly slower sometimes 
 they will be slightly faster 
 depends on some cpu spikes from other 
 processes 
 what won't change is that my slow 
 examples will still remain slow while my 
 faster examples should hopefully be 
 faster 
 and this is the important bit 
 okay 
 when you want to do some action and you 
 are not sure if it will work there are 
 two common patterns how you can approach 
 this in your code you can explicitly 
 check if what you're trying to do is 
 possible and then do this so 
 let's say you're trying to read the 
 content of a file but you're not sure if 
 the file is there so you'd 
 right on if if the file is there you 
 read it and you return it 
 but even if the file exists maybe you 
 don't have permissions to read it so you 
 add another check and then the number of 
 checks will keep growing but you still 
 have no guarantee that some unexpected 
 error won't prevent you from reading 
 this file 
 so there is a different approach that 
 you can try 
 so in this alternative version you just 
 do the action and in case something goes 
 wrong you wrap your code in a try except 
 block 
 so let's see which one of those 
 approaches is faster 
 i will use a slightly simpler example so 
 let's say i have a base class that might 
 or might not have a specific attribute 
 and that i make a subclass and 
 in the subclass i want to access my 
 attribute but if the attribute was not 
 set in the base class i will get an 
 exception 
 so i can either check 
 if my object foo has the attribute hello 
 and before accessing it or i can try to 
 access this attribute and catch the 
 attribute error in case it was not there 
 so in other words i can ask for 
 permission to access a given attribute 
 or i can ask for forgiveness after 
 accessing a non-existing attribute 
 and if we run our benchmarks we can see 
 that asking for permission is around 15 
 percent slower than asking for 
 forgiveness 
 slightly slower but not some crazy 
 amount 
 but what if our class has more than one 
 attribute and we still need to check all 
 of them since one of them might be 
 missing 
 so 
 this time i'm using a class that is 
 supposed to have three attributes and we 
 want to check if all of them exist 
 before we perform some action 
 so with more attributes to check now the 
 difference between both code examples 
 starts to be more prominent 
 now asking for permissions is around 80 
 percent slower 
 so does it mean that asking for 
 forgiveness is always the best choice 
 well let's see what happens if the 
 attribute is actually missing 
 so here i commented out one of the 
 attributes that we are we are trying to 
 access 
 and when i run my benchmarks one more 
 time i can see a completely opposite 
 picture of what we saw before 
 asking for forgiveness is almost four 
 times as slow as asking for permission 
 so the tables have turned because 
 handling exceptions is expensive 
 so a good rule of thumb here is to ask 
 yourself is it more likely that my code 
 will throw an exception or not 
 if the answer is yes 
 i will probably get an exception and you 
 can predict what will go wrong then an 
 if statement is a good idea 
 it will be faster than handling the 
 exception and it will much better show 
 the intention of your code 
 but if you find yourself putting a ton 
 of if statements only to catch some 
 exceptions that happens once in a while 
 and on top of that your code already 
 failed twice because you forgot about 
 some corner case then 
 maybe it's better to use the ask for 
 forgiveness approach and just wrap your 
 code in a try accept block 
 let's see an example of how you can 
 iterate over a collection of items and 
 find the one that matches some criteria 
 so let's say i want to find the first 
 number that can be divided by 42 and 43 
 i could use a naive approach and write a 
 while loop that would start iterating 
 from 1 return the value if it's divided 
 divided by 42 and 43 
 and otherwise just check the next number 
 and while there is nothing wrong with 
 the while approach 
 we are manually incrementing the counter 
 which feels like a lot of unnecessary 
 code so we can do better 
 we can instead use a for loop and a 
 counter that will keep giving us the 
 next number until we find the one we are 
 looking for 
 and if we measure the execution 
 execution time of both functions we can 
 see that the while loop is around 25 
 percent slower than the for loop 
 but more importantly the for loop is a 
 bit more concise and i like it much more 
 but what if someone told you that python 
 is all about list comprehensions 
 and for loops are bad if you're dealing 
 with least you should just use these 
 comprehensions all the time okay let's 
 give it a try 
 so here i'm checking the first 
 10 000 numbers if they are divisible by 
 42 and 43 
 and then i just returned the first 
 element that matches this criteria 
 as you can probably guess using least 
 comprehension is a terrible idea we are 
 unnecessarily creating at least over 10 
 000 elements just to grab the first one 
 it might make sense to use it if we 
 really wanted to check those first 10 
 000 numbers but we just need to get the 
 first element that matches so 
 what we need here is some kind of a lazy 
 list comprehension 
 and a lazy list comprehension is 
 basically a generator expression 
 so we can write a generator expression 
 that will filter the list of numbers 
 based on our criteria and simply grab 
 the first element using the next 
 function 
 generator expressions will do just 
 enough work to give us the first number 
 and then stop 
 and if we benchmark it it turns out that 
 it's as fast as the for loop 
 so generator expressions are a great 
 alternative to list comprehension 
 if you need to evaluate them lazily they 
 are fast concise and memory efficient 
 but 
 if you want to check multiple conditions 
 and 
 you could in principle wrap all of them 
 in like a function and then call this 
 function in your generator but sometimes 
 that's just too much so i prefer to 
 stick with a plain old for loops 
 while we are talking about lists let's 
 take a look at another example let's say 
 i have a list of numbers and i want to 
 get only the odd ones i can write a for 
 loop that will do the job 
 and for filtering 1 million of numbers 
 it takes 33 milliseconds 
 but since we're filtering something 
 there is a literally function called 
 filter in the standard library so we can 
 use that to simplify our code 
 and now our code is simpler but it's 
 also around 50 slower 
 so instead of using the filter function 
 we can try to use the least 
 comprehension since we are constructing 
 a list 
 and the least comprehension is a clear 
 winner a for loop is around 30 percent 
 slower and filter is almost twice as 
 slow as the least comprehension 
 so in this example we tried to use three 
 different structures and 
 while the least comprehension is the 
 fastest one and in my opinion the most 
 readable one 
 each of the constructs that we use 
 actually has a valid use case 
 well these comprehensions are the 
 obvious choice if you want to build a 
 new list but if you don't need to have 
 the whole list at once the filter 
 function is actually quite useful 
 because it returns an iterator 
 so if we take a look back at the second 
 example we can see that we are actually 
 calling list 
 to 
 give us 
 a list from whatever filter returns 
 and it's this list creation that takes a 
 lot of time so if you need an iterator 
 that will generate you the next value 
 only when needed filter is a great 
 choice 
 and finally we have the for loop which 
 some people might might call non-pytonic 
 but 
 there is a limited amount of if 
 statements that you can put in a list 
 comprehension before it becomes 
 unreadable so for more complex filtering 
 conditions i just stick with the for 
 loop 
 okay let's cover one more example of 
 these and we will switch gears to 
 something else how do we check if an 
 element exists in a list 
 let's say i have a list of 1 million 
 numbers and i want to check if a 
 specific element is there 
 again we can do this with a for loop 
 just iterating over the list of numbers 
 return true if we find the number we are 
 looking for otherwise we return false 
 but we can achieve the same results 
 simply using the in operator 
 it's much less code and as you can 
 probably guess it's faster 
 so let's run some benchmarks um so i'm 
 running benchmarks for three scenarios 
 first one is when the element is located 
 at the beginning of the list the second 
 one when the element is located at the 
 end of the list and then when the 
 element is not in the list at all 
 and the results are pretty consistent 
 across the board we can see that using 
 the for loop is around twice as slow as 
 using the membership testing operator 
 okay that was kind of a boring example i 
 mean if you know the in operator you 
 will probably not write a for loop to 
 check if an element exists in a list but 
 we are not done yet we can do better 
 instead of using a list we can use a set 
 lookup time in a list has on time 
 complexity so the bigger the list the 
 longer it takes to execute the in 
 statement 
 but 
 the average lookup time in a set is 
 constant 
 and if we run the benchmarks we can see 
 that something very interesting so for 
 an element located at the beginning of 
 the list the lookup time is only six 
 times as slow as the lookup in a set 
 i'm saying only six times because if the 
 element is located at the end of the 
 list or it's not in the list at all then 
 the lookup time in the list is over a 
 hundred thousand times slower 
 that's impressive 
 it would be even more impressive if i 
 wasn't cheating 
 um i did not include converting a list 
 to a set in my benchmarks i only created 
 the set in the setup part of my code and 
 in the benchmarks i was already checking 
 the numbers in a set 
 but if you're starting with a list you 
 will have to convert it to a set and 
 that takes time so let's update our 
 benchmarks with a proper function that 
 does the conversion from a list to a set 
 first and then checks the membership 
 and when i compare the time it takes to 
 do a membership testing in a list versus 
 converting a list to a set and then 
 doing the membership testing i see a 
 completely different picture 
 doing the conversion takes twice as long 
 as doing the lookup in a list 
 and that's a scenario when the element 
 is located at the end of a list or 
 doesn't exist in a list but if the 
 element is at the beginning of the list 
 conversion makes our code almost 40 000 
 times 
 slower so to conclude this example 
 using for loops for performing 
 membership testing is a terrible idea 
 using the in operator is usually twice 
 as fast 
 the average lookup time in a list grows 
 as the list gets bigger but 
 [Music] 
 it's constant in a set so if you already 
 have a list then converting it to a set 
 just to do one lookup doesn't make much 
 sense 
 but if you have a choice between 
 constructing the list or a set in the 
 first place if you choose to construct 
 the set then you will get some really 
 nice 
 speedup improvements in the membership 
 testing 
 and one last remark 
 set is not a drop in replacement for a 
 list for example set is not ordered so 
 don't randomly change your data 
 structures because some guy at the 
 conference told you that it's gonna make 
 your code run a hundred thousand times 
 faster 
 um just read about different data 
 structures in python and the time 
 complexity for the most common 
 operations and there is this really 
 really nice wiki page where you can find 
 tables for everything highly recommended 
 let's talk about creating dictionaries 
 so there are two ways how we can create 
 a dictionary one is to call the dict 
 function and the other is to use the 
 literal syntax and just write those two 
 squiggly brackets 
 and in many cases they are equivalent so 
 you might not give it much thought and 
 assume that they both take the same 
 amount of time 
 actually if we measure the execution 
 time it turns out that the dict function 
 is twice as slow as using the brackets 
 and that kind of surprised me so i 
 decided to dig a bit deeper to see 
 what's going on 
 so if i i fired up the disassembler for 
 python by code and i looked uh what 
 happens when i call each of those 
 functions so what this module does it it 
 prints you the 
 bytecode instructions that will be 
 executed 
 and even though i usually have no idea 
 what most of the instructions there 
 means the important part is this call 
 function 
 you see nothing stops you from doing 
 that in your code 
 i mean this is stupid but python allows 
 you to be stupid 
 so when you call the dict function 
 python interpreter has to check that 
 maybe you actually overrode this dict 
 functions somewhere 
 but 
 if you use the curly brackets you use a 
 python statement so there is no way for 
 you to override this and python can 
 directly call the corresponding bytecode 
 instruction 
 that's why using the literal syntax for 
 creating dictionaries list or tuples is 
 faster than calling the equivalent 
 functions and this module is a really 
 nice tool 
 that can show you the bytecode 
 instructions that are executed when you 
 run some code 
 so if you're curious how something works 
 under the hood you can check it out 
 let's say you want to remove duplicates 
 from a list 
 here i have a list of 1 million numbers 
 each of them between 0 and 99 i can 
 write a for loop that will go through 
 the duplicates list and append the 
 unique numbers to a new list 
 and then i just return that list 
 i could also write a list comprehension 
 that does the exact same thing 
 and if i benchmark both of those 
 approaches 
 i can see that they take the same amount 
 of time 
 except that this is a terrible way to 
 use list comprehension 
 this comprehension should be used when 
 you are creating a list but in our case 
 we want it for the side effect of 
 appending the current number to some 
 external list and the least 
 comprehension will still create us a 
 list of nouns that we immediately 
 discard 
 so in this case it's much better to 
 stick with a for loop to show our to 
 show the intention of our code 
 but there is a data structure that we 
 already talked about that by definition 
 doesn't contain duplicates 
 any guesses 
 set 
 yes 
 so we can take our list of duplicates 
 convert it to a set and then convert it 
 back to a list 
 and doing that is way faster using the 
 for loop is over 50 times slower than 
 simply converting our our list to a set 
 and back to a lease 
 there is one caveat with this method 
 though 
 sets don't preserve the insertion order 
 so 
 what we get from this list to set to 
 least conversion might have a different 
 order than our for loop 
 so if you want to keep the initial order 
 there is this trick with dictionaries 
 you can create dictionary 
 with keys taken from a list and then 
 convert the dictionary back to a list 
 this will remove the duplicates and 
 preserve the insertion order 
 and if we benchmark this we can see that 
 it's still much faster than the for loop 
 now the for loop takes around 28 times 
 longer than the dictionary trick 
 there is a small caveat though 
 the dictionary trick only works with 
 elements that are hashable because 
 dictionary keys have has to be hashable 
 and hashable means immutable so if you 
 have a list of lists or a list of 
 dictionaries 
 then this method won't work 
 okay as a bonus exercise i decided to 
 run all my examples through different 
 python versions so i simply wrote the 
 one large shell script that runs all the 
 commands in the terminal 
 and then i use spine to switch to 
 different python versions so i switch to 
 python 3.7 run my benchmarks which do 
 python 3.8 run my benchmarks and so on 
 if you're curious how to use pyenv i 
 have a blog post on that 
 and here we have the results 
 so on the left side we can see the 
 functions that i was checking and on the 
 top we can see python versions and in 
 the last column we can see how much 
 slower was python 3.7 versus 3.11 latest 
 beta release 
 that's a lot of numbers so i put the 
 most significant ones in bolt 
 as you can see python 3.11 is a clear 
 winner in terms of performance 
 improvements for most of those small 
 code snippets but even for older 
 versions performance usually improves as 
 you upgrade your python version with 
 some occasional minor degradations here 
 and there 
 so what happened in python 311 
 well 
 in 2020 mark shannon one of the core c 
 python developers proposed that he can 
 make c python faster by a factor of five 
 it would take four stages with first two 
 being general tweaks and improvements 
 and the last two would implement some 
 sort of a simple jit compiler 
 and now mark is working at microsoft 
 with guido and some other smart people 
 implementing those ideas and the speed 
 improvements in python 311 are the first 
 fruits of their labors 
 actually mark is giving a talk in this 
 room right after mine so i'm really 
 looking forward to hear about the 
 progress of this project sounds very 
 interesting 
 and here we have the rest of my 
 benchmarks and you can find all the 
 results in the benchmarks results folder 
 in the github repository for the stock 
 and i wish i could show you more 
 examples because i had a lot of fun 
 gathering them but i am running out of 
 time so whatever didn't make it to this 
 presentation i put it in the repository 
 for this talk you can find some examples 
 there with benchmarks 
 i also left some examples where the 
 alternative version which i was 
 expecting it to be faster but it wasn't 
 and i also put some comments why it's 
 not faster 
 and this whole idea for this 
 presentation started as a list of 
 articles on my blog so if you want to 
 get more details about the examples i 
 showed you you can 
 [Music] 
 find them on my blog 
 i have around 10 articles and i didn't 
 have time to update my blog in two years 
 but i have plenty of more ideas so i 
 promise you when i get back to blogging 
 there will be more examples 
 okay we still have like five minutes 
 let's jump to conclusions 
 source code optimization is often the 
 last thing you think about when you have 
 performance issues 
 and 
 that makes sense i mean you 
 you don't start optimizing your code by 
 rewriting it from scratch unless you 
 have a terrible code to start with 
 but source code optimization is not 
 something that you should be doing when 
 you have performance issues 
 rather it should be something that you 
 should keep in the back of your head 
 when you write your code in the first 
 place being curious about which code 
 structures are faster will lead you to 
 understanding python better 
 understanding which data structure is 
 better in a specific scenario and 
 sometimes even understanding what is 
 happening under the hood of your code 
 replacing this comprehension a for loop 
 with a list comprehension when you are 
 writing the code is an easy thing to do 
 and even though it might increase the 
 speed of your code by let's say 20 
 percent 
 if you replace few loops here you change 
 the data structure here you use a 
 built-in function there suddenly you 
 will realize that your code is now twice 
 as fast 
 and last but not least please don't 
 sacrifice the readability of your code 
 for some small performance gains 
 sure fast code is good fast code that is 
 hard to read is not good 
 thank you so much for listening you can 
 find all the links here 
 [Applause] 
 thank you very much for that great talk 
 sebastian 
 uh we do have a few more minutes time 
 for questions from the audience so if 
 somebody would like to ask a question 
 please step up to the microphone 
 hey uh thanks for your talk i have one 
 comment about the example with uh 
 permissions 
 so there was this like if condition 
 whether we have access to a file 
 uh if we can come back to this yep 
 it's a bit of a clicking but 
 come on 
 yeah 
 um 
 that wasn't a very serious example that 
 was just to 
 show you 
 yeah so 
 i would say the main problem here is 
 that the top uh example i mean the one 
 with if conditions is actually broken i 
 mean insecure 
 because you have a race condition 
 between those like os path exists os 
 access and open i mean between opening a 
 file and trying and checking its access 
 the file can like reappear be delayed be 
 deleted or anything else 
 so i would say that's the main issue 
 here and that's why you should always 
 use just 
 trying to do something instead of like 
 checking your access that's a very good 
 point i i didn't even run this code this 
 is just like but it sounded close in 
 python it it but it makes a lot of sense 
 to like uh 
 just uh 
 with the other example with like 
 checking the attributes 
 but then with checking attributes there 
 is another issue that usually your code 
 is more complex and you might have this 
 like accept being triggered in a 
 situation where you didn't expect it and 
 then it's hard to debug great is there 
 an actual question or are we going to 
 just yeah thank you very much we have 
 also questions from the internet so 
 could we please have the remote question 
 hi hi there 
 first of all congratulations on your 
 talk it was awesome 
 second my question uh the first time you 
 mentioned the difference between 
 loop and the least comprehension i'm not 
 sure which slide was it 
 could you tell a little bit if you know 
 why is it slower 
 about the interns working because 
 as i mentioned in the end usually uh 
 more 
 beginners python tends to go for 
 a for loop instead of least 
 comprehensive so i was thinking why 
 there is this difference in time do you 
 have any idea 
 uh frankly no i wish there was like a c 
 python developer who could answer this 
 question i i guess the python okay there 
 is 
 sorry 
 because 
 if the difference is 
 [Music] 
 so the main difference is function calls 
 like if you have a list object and you 
 are calling list dot append this append 
 needs to be looked up in the object and 
 it can actually be replaced because well 
 c python doesn't prevent you from doing 
 so and that's the main reason why list 
 comprehension are much faster than using 
 like a for loop and appending to a list 
 yeah because you can always like inline 
 your functions to make them faster so i 
 would assume that lookup takes quite 
 some time 
 yeah 
 okay great thanks thank you very much 
 for the remote question and we can have 
 one more uh question in the auditorium 
 please uh hi thank you for the it for 
 the talk um 
 you mentioned number in the beginning 
 and you 
 throw this jet 
 decorator there's also the number engine 
 or no python mode for number which 
 maybe in this case and also in when when 
 working with nunpai specifically uh it 
 uh bypasses the jail 
 um which also like leads to much higher 
 speed ups than you shown now is that 
 also did you also run this uh example 
 with uh with no python mode uh not this 
 specific example no i just wanted to 
 mention that there is this library which 
 i find super cool because you just 
 another decorator in the world it's 
 really cool but you have a good point 
 there is jit and engine so depending on 
 your use case one might be faster than 
 the other 
 thank you 
 okay we can still take questions so 
 please 
 uh in python 2 there was always the 
 example of 
 when you add up many strings you could 
 do it with append 
 or you could 
 create all the strings and do a join 
 and everybody used that as an example of 
 an optimization does it still apply 
 good point i was looking at the string 
 concatenation and then i saw that there 
 are like 
 many ways to do this because now we have 
 the f string so we can use template 
 strings f strings and so on i decided 
 this is way too complicated so i didn't 
 pursue this idea but i would be curious 
 to check it as well 
 okay thanks 
 okay thank you very much for all these 
 questions 
 and thanks again sebastian for 
 delivering this great talk so let's have 
 another round of applause for sebastian 
 please 
 and we will now take a five to six 
 minute break and then continue with the 
 next talk thank you 
 both in core app development django 
 flask and 
 uh and across full stack as well 
 in terms of doing something special for 
 the attendees we have a really 
 interesting speaker this year in terms 
 of night o'connor talking about asset 
 price reversals um 
 without the normal swag and uh special 
 gifts for people and we'll be doing some 
 some raffles and giveaways um and if 
 there's anyone who wants to talk to us 
 at the desk we're here all all through 
 the conference guess we chose europe 
 because a it's in dublin and it's a it's 
 the first time since uh be covered times 
 have been able to get people together 
 and really you know promote what we do 
 in in bank america in terms of python um 
 you know it's a very much a python 
 focused uh conference which is really 
 where our tech stack lies and where a 
 lot of our projects are within bank of 
 america 
 so hi my name is marianne shine and i'm 
 the head of hr and operations with 
 umnitsa in ireland 
 so this is umnitz's first year to 
 sponsor euro python we're so excited to 
 celebrate this year and participate in 
 euro python 
 coming to ireland so umnitza is a u.s 
 company with our r d based in galway in 
 the west of ireland we have employees 
 all over ireland and we thought this 
 would be a great opportunity to bring 
 them along today and participate in the 
 ecosystem the python ecosystem 
 and really learn from 
 other professionals within this area 
 this year we're actually sponsoring the 
 pie ladies lunch so nitza are very 
 passionate about gender diversity within 
 our engineering team in galway we 
 currently have 33 percent um females in 
 our team and so we're very privileged 
 and honored to sponsor the pie ladies 
 lunch which i think is taking place on 
 friday so we're very excited to be here 
 i think europe python is a very unique 
 conference 
 and because i think it 
 brings people who are passionate about 
 python together 
 and really gives them the opportunity to 
 learn about the most progressive 
 practices within python and also 
 leverage the wider 
 python ecosystem

 in my team execution research everything 
 starts from data 
 after getting the data we do our 
 research and analysis on this data to 
 test our ideas 
 and then finally we have to get it in an 
 output format such that trading or 
 trading strategies can pick this up and 
 this whole workflow almost exclusively 
 works in python 
 working in a company that has 
 aspirations to be the best at what they 
 do that's what drives people solving 
 problems and having the best people with 
 you trying to solve those problems you 
 can't beat that 
 there are people who are actually able 
 to not only look at the data and 
 understand it but analyze it and express 
 it in a way that others understand 
 and that's i suppose that's the gift of 
 a great storyteller 
 [Music] 
 we're here 
 at microsoft and we have been sponsoring 
 era python for i believe four years now 
 it's been some time and we're excited to 
 be back here this year yeah so for euro 
 python this year um our team has has a 
 few talks uh lined up for some attendees 
 so we're doing that and we also have 
 some cool swag and stickers for all the 
 attendees as well some of them might be 
 limited edition we'll see 
 and we absolutely love europe python 
 because of the community the european 
 community is amazing and we 
 love being able to see them in hearing 
 person get this just this connection 
 that we don't we can't have virtually 
 but it's always not the same in person 
 is always like that 
 really great conversations and we get 
 like 
 great feedback from our users as well 
 but most importantly it's the 
 conversations about how much we love 
 python all the amazing things we do 
 with this like the european 
 community 
 so we're a brand new sponsor for uh for 
 europe python this year bank of america 
 mainly here as a recruitment drive we 
 have you know plenty of open roles in 
 the python space 
 both in core app development django 
 flask and 
 uh and across full stack as well 
 in terms of doing something special for 
 the attendees we have a really 
 interesting speaker this year in terms 
 of nile o'connor talking about asset 
 price reversals um 
 uh without the normal swag and uh 
 special gifts for people and we'll be 
 doing some some raffles and giveaways 
 um and if there's anyone who wants to 
 talk to us at the at the desk we're here 
 all through the conference i guess we 
 chose european because a it's in dublin 
 and it's the it's the first time since 
 peak overtime so we've been able to get 
 people together and really you know 
 promote what we do in bank america in 
 terms of python um 
 you know it's a very much 
 a python focused uh conference which is 
 really where our tech stack lies and 
 where a lot of our projects are within 
 bank of america 
 so hi my name is marianne shine and i'm 
 the head of hr and operations with 
 umnitza in ireland 
 so this is umnitz's first year to 
 sponsor european we're so excited to 
 celebrate this year and participate in 
 europe python 
 coming to ireland so umnitza is a us 
 company with our orandie based in galway 
 in the west of ireland 
 okay with all the technical troubles 
 solved here um 
 we 
 can continue quickly with our series of 
 talks on faster python we just learned 
 how to write past the code and and now 
 we are learning from mark shannon who's 
 a technical lead uh the fastest c python 
 team funded by microsoft and the c 
 python car developer on the approaches 
 being taken to make 
 python 3.11 faster please give a round 
 of applause to mark 
 hello 
 okay so as i said i'm the technical lead 
 on the fastest c python team 
 uh the fast c python project started 
 just over a year ago 
 uh we made some small changes in 310 and 
 we've already started making changes in 
 312. 
 so but this talk is really focused on 
 what the changes we've made in 311 
 uh it's possible that some of the things 
 i say aren't 100 true for 311 there may 
 be elements of the others but but it's 
 more okay to give you a feel for the 
 sort of changes we've made and how it 
 all fits together 
 so 
 c python is a computer program like many 
 others it's written in c hence the name 
 and it runs on a computer so 
 in order to make it faster it helps to 
 understand first of all how the computer 
 runs on works 
 uh some understanding of the hardware is 
 helpful we don't need to be able to 
 build a machine or maintain it but we 
 need some sort of feeling for its 
 performance characteristics and how they 
 work 
 now modern cpus are complicated things 
 this is an architecture diagram it's a 
 slightly out of date machine 
 but i want to bring attention to a 
 couple of things first of all it's 
 multiple core but that doesn't really 
 interest us because of the infamous gill 
 but even if there wasn't a gill 
 the uh we'd expect each core to be 
 running a separate thread so all these 
 apple uh 
 the optimizations we're gonna talked 
 about would only really apply to one 
 thread anyway but what is interesting is 
 that within each core 
 there is parallelism 
 uh 
 every time an instruction is fetched 
 it's several instructions usually 
 fetched at one time and then multiple 
 instructions are dispatched there's 
 multiple execution units in each core 
 allowing you to do several introduce 
 operations or several floating point 
 operations or several memory accesses 
 concurrently 
 and that's kind of the interesting thing 
 about these cpus they're called 
 superscalar for this reason 
 um 
 the other thing that's important is 
 memory access is important now is slow 
 now if we go back to the previous thing 
 there's no real memory on here but 
 you'll see elements of caches and those 
 caches are there to speed up memory 
 access 
 um it takes a long time for 
 light to move around 
 if you're clocking at five gigahertz in 
 five gigahertz light moves six 
 centimeters it's not very far and 
 electrons move considerably slower than 
 that 
 so it takes physically it's just 
 impossible to make memory access fast 
 that's just a physical limitation so the 
 way we work around the cpus work around 
 is they have layers of cache they have a 
 tiny l1 cache and i mean tiny as in a 
 few kilobytes 
 and that's only four cycles delay then 
 there's a l2 cache which is typically 10 
 cycles uh l3 cache which is larger still 
 and shared but across the cores and 
 that's usually used for sort of 
 intercourse communication 
 that's 30 cycles and then ram is a 
 couple hundred cycles 
 these superscalar cpus can work around 
 the delays and they can push forwards 
 some execution while others are delayed 
 but as a first sort of general principle 
 we want to avoid memory accesses 
 the exact details are very hard to work 
 out trying to get precise timings is 
 extremely hard on modern 
 hardware but just bear in mind a simple 
 thing that 
 if you have 
 uh 
 a memory access it's generally going to 
 be slow 
 and 
 because i said the superscalar 
 it's dependent memory access is the 
 thing we really want to avoid so if we 
 have two memory accesses and we can do 
 both at the same time because they're 
 independent the cpu can largely do them 
 at the same time 
 if we have a memory access that depends 
 on another memory access in other words 
 we need the data from the first one to 
 work out whether to look in the memory 
 for the second one that's going to be 
 doubly slow 
 okay 
 now back in 1976 uh nicholas vert was 
 famous computer scientist he wrote this 
 textbook 
 it's called algorithm plus data 
 structures equals programs which is a 
 large slightly fuzzy picture i've got 
 our hammers in there 
 now 
 i just want to sort of split this thing 
 into two so there are basically 
 before object oriented programs which 
 kind of merge the whole concept of data 
 structures and 
 algorithms 
 this was a kind of important way of 
 looking at programs and it still applies 
 to sort of low level system stuff like 
 cpython or linux or windows or other 
 things like that 
 um so we're going to sort of split this 
 talk into two the sort of data 
 structures part 
 and algorithms 
 so first of all we're going to look at 
 the data structure so we're going to 
 look at some data structures and see 
 python 
 and how we've changed them in 311 for 
 better performance 
 right but before we get into real data 
 structures just a little quick 
 sort of side just to give you a feel for 
 this sort of thing 
 so 
 uh a linked list is a data structure you 
 might be familiar with from your 
 computer classes or from bad job 
 interviews where they ask you to 
 implement a linked list 
 and 
 as you can see from the the image 
 uh and comparing with an array list it's 
 quite an inefficient structure 
 it's inefficient in a couple of ways so 
 suppose we want to inter access the 
 integer 2 at the second in index 2 in 
 the in the list 
 in the array list on the left 
 is on the left isn't it yes the 
 arraylist on the left we need to follow 
 four links and because we're following a 
 link we need to read the memory 
 uh in the head to point to the link once 
 we've read that we know where the link 
 is and then we can read the memory and 
 that so there's just four dependent 
 memory loads to get to two 
 if we look at the array list on the 
 right it's only the two loads 
 still dependent but it's only two 
 and not only that every time we want to 
 add an element to the list we need to 
 allocate more memory now allocating 
 memory is another slow operation i mean 
 not for physical reasons just because 
 there's lots of code involved 
 um 
 so 
 yeah so just sort of designing the data 
 structures to avoid these dependent 
 loads and excessive memory allocations 
 is kind of important 
 but before we look at the implementation 
 of any data structures i just want to 
 give you a quick refresher on uh frame 
 stacks and frames in python 
 whenever you call a python function we 
 need somewhere to put the values in the 
 local variables any temporary variables 
 the ax the reference to the module 
 globals and a few other bits and pieces 
 and these go in a frame object 
 uh this frame contains what i've said 
 let's say what it contains and so 
 every time you call a python function we 
 take we create a new frame object and 
 then it calls other python functions 
 that push frame objects and so on and so 
 we form a stack 
 of frame objects 
 now note i use the term stack here 
 because 
 in python 310 and earlier we have this 
 which is awfully like the linked list 
 example i gave you as before now this 
 isn't as bad as the linked list because 
 we only ever really want to access the 
 top frame that we're currently executing 
 so we don't have to worry about the sort 
 of extra cost of following the links 
 but we do need to worry about the memory 
 allocation we're allocating memory each 
 time now in python 310 earlier there was 
 some sort of caching involved but 
 conceptually we still have to do this 
 allocation and even with the caching 
 it's not as efficient as it could be 
 now the point is this is a stack 
 so 
 we implement it as a stack in 310. 
 so in 310 we just allocate a big chunk 
 of memory per thread is actually sort of 
 several link chunks because we don't 
 know in advance how big the stack is 
 going to get 
 but in almost all cases we can just uh 
 allocate a fret a new frame by just 
 reusing the memory in that chunk 
 now this has a number of advantages and 
 we still need the sort of link pointer 
 to follow which i'll come to why we need 
 that in a minute 
 um 
 but 
 it's still much faster than 
 uh having to chase around memory just 
 because we can compute the offsets from 
 one to the other 
 but also what i was saying earlier about 
 caches the thing with a stack 
 is that 
 the bit you're just using is probably 
 the bit you've just used for a previous 
 function so it's still in the cache 
 almost certainly 
 which means as opposed to a new frame 
 which might be anywhere in memory and 
 may not be in the caches so the cache 
 performance of this is about as good as 
 you can get 
 and we're not having to do a new 
 allocation for each time we call a 
 python function 
 but 
 you may be wondering doesn't this change 
 the python semantics i don't think some 
 of you will have used sys.getframe 
 um 
 unfortunately we all have encountered 
 exceptions 
 uh exceptions come with a traceback and 
 that traceback includes frame objects so 
 how do we do with this 
 so what we do in this case 
 is we when we need to we allocate a 
 frame object 
 so 
 you can imagine that i've only just 
 shown the frame object for the the frame 
 on the top of the stack but you can 
 imagine ones for each in 
 each frame 
 you can imagine we'd allocate a frame 
 object for each one the one in yellow 
 and the lower one in white 
 and we would link those as if they were 
 the previous ones so effectively we 
 could sort of lazily recreate this sort 
 of stack if we need to 
 so basically this is a general principle 
 of optimization we do we 
 design it so that the special the usual 
 case the common case is fast 
 and 
 make sure that we can continue to 
 perform correctly for the less common 
 case even though the less common case 
 might end up being slightly slower than 
 it was in earlier versions 
 typically normal execution becomes 
 faster 
 and raising exception becomes a tiny bit 
 slower 
 unless your code is 
 odd shall we say 
 you would expect that reception should 
 be relatively rare 
 um i mean we give an example earlier if 
 you sort of look before you leap thing 
 where the exceptions have become a 
 little more common 
 but generally you know they're still the 
 rare case and those pieces of code are 
 not typical code anyway you will have 
 some of them your code base but in terms 
 of sort of execution counts they're rare 
 one other thing you may have noticed in 
 this is it looks like i might be 
 cheating by dropping a few things here 
 to make it look smaller but one of those 
 is so there's a debug information in 
 there which we lazily allocate in the 
 frame object here 
 and the other is the exception stack 
 now the exception stack we've dropped in 
 311 because we have what's called zero 
 cost exceptions zero cost exceptions is 
 their technical name obviously they're 
 not really zero cost because nothing is 
 but they're pretty close 
 the way exceptions worked in 310 is that 
 if you had a try accept statement 
 the 
 the uh what would happen is when you hit 
 the try statement the try 
 we would push a little uh 
 piece of data onto a stack internal 
 stack which told us where to go 
 and what uh how much stuff to pop off 
 the execution stack if there were an 
 exception and then we got the end of the 
 try body that would be popped off that 
 works perfectly 
 but it means every time you enter a try 
 and leave try you're doing a little bit 
 of work and we need somewhere to put 
 that stuff as well those things 
 so 
 that took up 160 bytes i think in 310 
 and earlier it was 240 bytes in each 
 frame 
 uh which is somewhat wasteful given and 
 that's because we have a maximum 
 exception depth of 20. 
 if you try and write try excepts and 
 nested 21 deep in python you'll get a 
 syntax error you've probably never done 
 that and i wouldn't recommend you do 
 okay so the way it works in 311 is that 
 instead of pushing these blocks what we 
 do is in the comp the bytecode compiler 
 we 
 analyze 
 where 
 the exception would jump to for each 
 bytecode and then we just create tables 
 that describe that and those tables are 
 stored alongside the normal code 
 um that's a little bit slower again when 
 an exception is raised but it has no 
 real cost when we don't raise an 
 exception there is a tiny cost obviously 
 because it uses a little bit more memory 
 in the code object but 
 so zero cost exceptions you're probably 
 considered as mostly zero cost 
 exceptions 
 okay 
 so that's frame objects now let's 
 discuss 
 the more sort of normal objects so 
 playing old python objects so here's a 
 plain old python object it doesn't do 
 anything just takes two attributes and 
 assigns it into itself 
 um 
 this 
 obviously most python objects look kind 
 of like this but with obviously some 
 extra code to actually do something 
 so this is a kind of standard python 
 object so let's look at how this is laid 
 out in memory 
 now 
 python objects 
 i know you may have heard this probably 
 you can consider python objects as just 
 a sort of a thin wrap around a 
 dictionary 
 essentially they give you that sort of 
 nice syntactic sugar where you can do 
 instead of like 
 looking up the 
 item in the dictionary by its sort of 
 quoted name 
 you just do a dot name attribute lookup 
 um that's sort of one way of looking at 
 it i mean we don't necessarily think of 
 them in that way but every object has 
 this done deduct attribute which will 
 allow you to get to this in dictionary 
 but almost all code nev doesn't actually 
 access the dictionary directly it's very 
 rarely used 
 um another thing we need to consider 
 about python objects is that they are 
 not fixed size now 
 what i mean by that is not that they can 
 have a variable number of attributes 
 because as you just said they kind of 
 belong in the dictionary 
 but it can also have other things that 
 sort of change the size of the the 
 python object this will become relevant 
 in a second when i show you the diagrams 
 uh objects can couldn't inherit from 
 built-in things like an integer or that 
 you can have done the slots which change 
 the layout of the object 
 so that's a little tricky 
 so a naive implementation this can be 
 rather slow and bulky so here's the 
 naive implementation we haven't had a 
 naive implementation since python 3.2 
 but i'm going to show you anyway because 
 i think it's illustrative of the sort of 
 overheads and the sort of the the sort 
 of logical simple way of 
 implementing this 
 so you have an object and has a pointer 
 to its class and it's dictionary 
 basically 
 except that because it's variable size 
 the pointer to the dictionary isn't at a 
 fixed offset so we need to look up what 
 the offset is in the class 
 now the color the light green color 
 basically is because that's our shared 
 instances in other words there's one of 
 those per class so if you have a 
 thousand instances of a class or a 
 million 
 uh there's only one of those so that's 
 in green because their memory cost is 
 effectively amortized but per additional 
 object is zero the red ones however 
 are 
 redundant information per instance in 
 other words there's stuff we really 
 don't need we want to get rid of so 
 basically you've got your object it's 
 got its class 
 it's got 
 a dictionary and those dictionaries is 
 basically an array of keys hashes and 
 values 
 so if you put a 
 a 
 a value in an object so we go back to 
 our self.a equals whatever 
 the object's dictionary conceptually has 
 the value 
 stored under the key a 
 and they'll be indexed somehow or other 
 and then there's we use a hash table 
 lookup and so on there's plenty other 
 talks and how dictionaries work 
 now in 310 in three three and onwards 
 we 
 change this so that the remove the 
 redundant keys and hashes they're moved 
 into a separate data structure which is 
 shared across the class in most cases 
 and then we have this 
 so now we just have we've got rid of a 
 lot of the redundancy there we now have 
 this table of values the keys and hashes 
 are a separate thing 
 and that's usually accessed from the 
 class where it's sort of cached 
 and then we have the dictionary that 
 points to those 
 but you'll see there's still some in red 
 so 
 we still have to go okay so one other 
 thing is if we want to access key 0 
 value 0 here no we have to follow these 
 four memory accesses we need to get the 
 class we need to get the dictionary 
 offset of the class we need to use that 
 dictionary offset to find the dictionary 
 pointer in the object we need to follow 
 that to the dictionary and then we need 
 to follow that to the table 
 in three three we use less memory but we 
 still have the three three to three ten 
 we still have that number of 
 indirections we still have to follow all 
 that 
 thing so the first thing we do 
 in 311 
 is move the pointers so we can there's 
 nothing physically stopping us putting 
 pointers in front of like the header of 
 the object 
 so we move the dictionary pointer in 
 front of that and that means it's a 
 fixed 
 offset which means we don't need to look 
 up its offset so this is the first thing 
 and we've already reduced the number of 
 indirections to get to our values to two 
 we haven't saved any memory yet 
 second thing we can now observe is that 
 that dictionary is redundant 
 it has a pointer to a keys well we can 
 add the pointer to the at a point of the 
 value sorry but we can add a point of 
 the values to the object 
 it has a header but it just tells us 
 it's a dictionary well we know it's a 
 dictionary as a point of the keys but we 
 can already access the keys via the 
 class 
 so we can just drop that 
 and this is what basically a python 
 object when you just created given the 
 example i i gave earlier just the simple 
 this very simple thing 
 uh and it will give us 
 this 
 so this is our nice sort of compact form 
 in three three eleven 
 okay so that's the data structure so it 
 was a bit of a whirlwind tour i realized 
 and it'll get 
 it won't get slower 
 uh okay so algorithms 
 so first of all bytecode 
 bytecode is what the 
 interpreter runs when it's running your 
 python program again there's plenty of 
 talks on this but i'll give you a very 
 brief 
 refresher or introduction depending on 
 whether you've seen this stuff before so 
 take the function on the left 
 it returns the a attribute of its 
 argument 
 the byte code on the right ignore the 
 resume that's just sort of a 
 administrative internal thing just to 
 mark the beginning of a function 
 what it does is it loads the local 
 variable itself onto the evaluation 
 stack 
 and then replaces that with a attribute 
 of that value and then it returns a 
 value on top of the stack 
 in this case 
 actually no i'll just carry on okay so 
 this is pep659 
 uh specialized the specializing adaptive 
 interpreter now this is kind of the 
 headline feature of 311 
 but the reason i did the day structures 
 first is because 
 much of what this does depends on how 
 those data structures are put together 
 and laid out 
 as i said earlier it's the number of 
 memory access that we do is often key 
 for performance 
 and designing our data structures to 
 allow us 
 to do stuff fast it's kind of important 
 before we can actually do things fast 
 so the specialized adaptive interpreter 
 basically has an idea that 
 for each byte code of you know in of 
 interest so not simple things like load 
 fast return value but the complicated 
 things like looking up an attribute you 
 know there's a million different ways 
 you can have well it's not millions like 
 13 or something but different ways of uh 
 attribute lookups you have properties 
 methods values on the attribute values 
 on the class 
 and you know special stuff done in c 
 code and so on and so forth 
 so 
 for 
 each instruction we basically have in 
 two states one is the kind of general 
 form which we call the adaptive form and 
 that's basically just does the sort of 
 general lookup that we did in 310 and 
 decrements a counter and when that 
 counter reaches zero we try and 
 specialize it and we also have the 
 specialized forms which are customized 
 for 
 you know particular values or types of 
 values that we see and those also have a 
 counter from misses so we don't know 
 that um every time you know just because 
 we've seen integers being added together 
 we don't know the next time we get to 
 that addition it's going to be 
 introduced it could be flowing point 
 number it could be strings 
 if we don't see the thing we'd had 
 before we fall back to the general case 
 and we decrement the counter this is 
 where it's adaptive because it can 
 flip-flop between these two states 
 ideally it basically it goes from the 
 adaptive to the specialized state and 
 stays there but you know code isn't 
 always 
 that straightforward so we need to sort 
 of cope reasonably efficiently when in 
 case it isn't 
 so basically there's the two forms of 
 specialization where we go from the 
 general to specialized form and 
 de-optimization where we go from the 
 specialized form to the optimized form 
 so before we get there there's sort of 
 quickening form so 
 going back to 
 this sort of bytecode i'm just going to 
 that bytecode is the one on the left 
 there and i've added a few little things 
 so actually internally we have some 
 what's called inline caches a little bit 
 of space in between some of the byte 
 codes for putting like 
 data that we kind of need to speed 
 things up 
 and the quickening form is we change the 
 basic to straightforward form the load 
 attribute to this load attribute 
 adaptive and it's basically the same 
 thing it does the same thing but it has 
 this counter so we get to the point 
 where it has this warm-up counter and 
 the walmart counters reaches one 
 now 
 next time we execute the warm-up counter 
 hit zero and we specialize so the 
 adaptive form on the left and the 
 specialized form on the right 
 now 
 assuming we're specializing the function 
 we should show four instances of the 
 class we showed earlier you know the 
 simple one that just has their a and b 
 attributes 
 we 
 specialize and we have this form called 
 load attribute instance value where 
 there's about 
 10 different forms of specializations of 
 load attribute 
 that might be wrong but it may have been 
 right at some point in the past it will 
 be right at some point in the future 
 because we keep changing the number 
 um 
 the load attribute instance value is for 
 this sort of simple case which is a 
 normal python class 
 nothing special no properties they're 
 just the values in the instance 
 so we have a miss counter and that says 
 every time we miss we decrement that and 
 which gets to zero we'll just go back to 
 the original form and possibly bounce 
 around a bit 
 we have a type version and that 
 basically says 
 we're interested in this current state 
 whether the current state of the 
 class of the value we're looking at 
 is it as it was when we specialize the 
 code so what we do is we add a version 
 number to all classes 
 and then when we change a class that 
 gets incremented 
 and then we can just check the version 
 number as i saw quick check and the 
 index here is the basically the index 
 into the values array 
 now we're not checking the keys here 
 which is an interesting thing and this 
 is basically a property of 
 the dictionary keys which i admitted to 
 mention earlier 
 which is that they cannot have keys 
 removed from them 
 so once we know the key is in 
 the 
 dictionary the cached dictionary keys on 
 the class 
 we know that it'll always remain in 
 there if a dictionary if we delete it 
 from 
 the 
 instance we can just null out that slot 
 if we change the class the instance so 
 much that we have to redo dictionary 
 keys then we just throw we don't use the 
 cached form and we have our own thing 
 okay 
 so 
 i just want to run through how this 
 works quickly this is unfortunately this 
 is c 
 code if you're not seeing c code about 
 don't worry i'll just go through this 
 before so how this works is so as i said 
 the object's on the top of the stack so 
 we pop that off 
 and then we look in its type and we 
 check the type version 
 that's just the read the cache and we 
 have the type version in the cache 
 should we check on the class 
 if we don't match we do this what's 
 called de-opt so we de-opt if this thing 
 has and d-opt is basically just uh 
 we 
 i'm just checking the time 
 so if we 
 de-opt we just uh increment decrement 
 the counter sorry and then fall back to 
 the sort of general form 
 if we don't do any d-ops we read out the 
 index 
 and then we're done now we have a few 
 bunch of memory reads here but these are 
 mostly independent there's one dependent 
 read in here so this is much simpler and 
 faster than the sort of more general 
 case 
 that's not the only specialization we do 
 we specialize a whole bunch of stuff 
 there's a whole bunch of there's the 
 byte codes on the left and the sort of 
 equivalent python code 
 on the right that we specialize 
 so 
 in summary we designed the data 
 structures to reduce the memory access 
 and then we design specialized bytecodes 
 to 
 for 
 you know common cases that we're likely 
 to see and we design those to take 
 advantage of those new data structures 
 such that 
 you know we can reduce the cost of a 
 thing so in other words we have this 
 data structures plus specialized code 
 equals faster python 
 uh i'm going to skip the future because 
 you have to come back next year to see 
 what we do in 312 if you can read really 
 fast there's some of the things we're 
 going to be doing 
 and 
 thank you 
 thank you very much mark 
 so let's see if this works i just want 
 to say on behalf of this whole team 
 thank you to all the other core 
 developers who've tolerated us breaking 
 stuff i particularly want to thank ken 
 jin and nada san and dennis sweeney for 
 their contributions 
 our team is paid but those are volunteer 
 contributions so i want to thank them 
 for doing that 
 yeah thank you very much again for your 
 presentation uh we have a very short 
 time for questions and we're going to 
 take the remote question first no uh 
 actually i just here we're going to take 
 a question from the audience first uh so 
 a quick question thanks for your talk um 
 there was this instance of the class and 
 it's layout you have this 
 dander dict attribute and it was 
 pointing to null do you actually need 
 this pointer at all right now uh well we 
 could in theory tag the values and 
 dictionary and shove them in the same 
 pointer but we can i mean obviously if 
 someone asks for a done dedict yeah 
 we'll need to fill that in and look at 
 the values and so this is um 
 basically there was a slide for it yeah 
 yeah yeah so we go from this and then if 
 someone wants the dictionary we just 
 fill it in and put that in and another 
 question can can you actually inline the 
 values inside the object and reallocated 
 when someone adds new uh attributes we 
 could do 
 that's definitely something we've 
 considered 
 um this is kind of a compromise between 
 flexibility and performance this we may 
 add them to the end the problem is that 
 it's 
 it's even more wasting if we get it 
 wrong with the values because we can't 
 they're just there so we have to 
 reassign values and we still need the 
 pointers so it's it's not clear which is 
 better thank you very much for the 
 question can we have the next question 
 please 
 uh hi it's very actually good to hear 
 that there's so many optimizations i 
 just want i was wondering with um so 
 many tricks in the book now uh do you 
 think that we may have someone expected 
 um non-determinism and like 
 pretty much bugs because now the code is 
 not executed in a very deterministic way 
 uh well it's sort of deterministic it's 
 just more complicated um so we do have 
 fixed counters i mean if we had random 
 counters that's 
 there's some advantage to randomizing 
 things but as you say non-determinism 
 one but to be honest it's always been 
 non-deterministic because the hardware 
 is largely 
 so in terms of performance in terms of 
 what it does it should i mean yeah if 
 it's not doing the same thing it's a bug 
 yeah and it's more complicated so there 
 are more likely to be bugs that is 
 definitely a thing i mean we're 
 obviously aware of that we do our best 
 not to do small bugs so there's a 
 there's a trade-off there's a slight 
 risk of introducing new bugs especially 
 in like obscure cases 
 um 
 and the question is are we willing to 
 trade that slight risk for significantly 
 increased performance and i i believe we 
 are we i am but i believe community as a 
 whole is 
 okay thank you very much for the 
 questions that's all the time we have 
 now 
 so let's have another round of applause 
 for mark and thanks for the talk 
 and we'd love to have you back like next 
 year 
 there will be a very short break and 
 then we'll continue in about five 
 minutes thank you 
 this year we're actually sponsoring the 
 pi ladies lunch so nitsa are very 
 passionate about gender diversity within 
 our engineering team in galway we 
 currently have 33 percent um females in 
 our team and so we're very privileged 
 and honored to sponsor the pie ladies 
 lunch which i think is taking place on 
 friday so we're very excited to be here 
 i think european python is a very unique 
 conference 
 and because i think it 
 brings people who are passionate about 
 python together 
 and really gives them the opportunity to 
 learn about the most progressive 
 practices within python and also 
 leverage the wider 
 python ecosystem

 us 
 so in my team execution research 
 everything starts from data 
 after getting the data we do our 
 research and analysis on this data to 
 test our ideas 
 and then finally we have to get it in an 
 output format such that trading or 
 trading strategies can pick this up and 
 this whole workflow almost exclusively 
 works in python 
 working in a company that has 
 aspirations to be the best at what they 
 do that's what drives people solving 
 problems and having the best people with 
 you trying to solve those problems you 
 can't beat that 
 there are people who are actually able 
 to not only look at the data and 
 understand it but analyze it and express 
 it in a way that others understand 
 [Music] 
 uh we're here 
 at microsoft and we have been sponsoring 
 era python for i believe four years now 
 it's been some time and we're excited to 
 be back here this year yeah so for euro 
 python this year um our team has a few 
 talks uh lined up for some of the 
 attendees so we're doing that and we 
 also have some cool swag and stickers 
 for all the attendees as well some of 
 them might be limited edition we'll see 
 and we absolutely love euro python 
 because of the community the european 
 community is amazing and we love being 
 able to see them in hearing person get 
 this just this connection that we nor we 
 can't have virtually but it's always not 
 the same in person is always like that 
 really great conversations and we get 
 like um 
 great feedback from our users as well 
 but most importantly it's the 
 conversations about how much we love 
 python all the amazing things we do 
 with this like the european 
 community 
 so we're a brand new sponsor for uh for 
 european this year bank of america 
 mainly here as a recruitment drive we 
 have plenty of open roads in the python 
 space 
 both in core app development django 
 flask and 
 uh and across full stack as well 
 in terms of doing something special for 
 the attendees we have a really 
 interesting speaker this year in terms 
 of niall o'connor talking about asset 
 price reversals 
 without the normal swag and 
 special gifts for people and we'll be 
 doing some some raffles and giveaways um 
 and if there's anyone who wants to talk 
 to us at the desk we're here all through 
 the conference guess we chose europe 
 because a it's in dublin and it's the 
 first time since uh be covered times 
 have been able to get people together 
 and really you know promote what we do 
 in in bank america in terms of python um 
 you know it's a very much 
 a python focused 
 conference which is really where our 
 tech stack lies and where a lot of our 
 projects are within bank of america 
 so hi my name is marianne shine and i'm 
 the head of hr and operations with 
 umnitza in ireland so this is umnitz's 
 first year to sponsor euro python we're 
 so excited to celebrate this year and 
 participate in euro python 
 coming to ireland so umnitza is a us 
 company with our r d based in galway in 
 the west of ireland we have employees 
 all over ireland and we thought this 
 would be a great opportunity to bring 
 them along today and participate in the 
 ecosystem the python ecosystem and 
 really learn from 
 other professionals within this area 
 this year we're actually sponsoring 
 okay we are ready to start the third 
 talk and we have a speaker from france 
 emanuel leblanc here and he's going to 
 tell us about security in the online 
 voting system for the french 
 presidential election uh let's have a 
 big round applause for emmanuel 
 please start your talk 
 hello hello everyone so uh uh i have not 
 much time because i have a really 
 big number of slides so i will go really 
 fast about me uh i'm emmanuel most of 
 the time i'm writing 
 i'm in a company writing a software 
 called parsec which has absolutely 
 nothing to do with the companion doing 
 gaming we choose the name at the same 
 time so yeah that's kind of thing happen 
 anyway so uh if you're interesting in a 
 really secure open source software with 
 end-to-end encryption you should take a 
 look it's in python all the source code 
 is there it's funny 
 uh anyway 
 i'm going to talk to you about something 
 totally unrelated 
 which is voting 
 so i'm not an expert in voting in any 
 way but i talk a lot with researchers 
 and so basically what i understood is 
 when you 
 using when you're talking about voting 
 system there is multiple property that 
 you have to evaluate 
 for instance the most common one is 
 the ballot secrecy so your voting of 
 course your vote must be secret 
 but there is other things for instance 
 you should not be able to um 
 to prove that you voted for somebody 
 because otherwise you could 
 go and ask for and get money from 
 someone else because you voted for the 
 right guy 
 or maybe you could get your leg broken 
 because you voted for the wrong guy 
 something else is what they call 
 auditability so basically 
 you need to be able to do 
 the ballot counting and about counting 
 it's better if there is a lot of 
 different party involved for doing the 
 ballot counting 
 all this kind of thing 
 and anyway 
 online voting 
 is 
 i mean the funny thing is all those 
 property they are not perfect when you 
 do 
 physical 
 voting but it's kind of work there is 
 issue but it's okay with online voting 
 it makes things really really really 
 complicated 
 uh 
 basically because here we can see there 
 is like a little billy uh he's a kid and 
 he understands what he's doing just by 
 voting he puts a physical proof of what 
 he wants what he wants to vote inside 
 this ballot box but on the other hand 
 there is a server for online voting and 
 nobody has any idea what's going on and 
 at the end of the election you have 
 absolutely no physical proof of what 
 happened 
 so if somebody is not happy with the 
 election 
 it's really hard to tell what you should 
 do 
 anyway so in france we have something 
 which is called the kneel which is a 
 commission national commission of 
 informatics i mean it's the translation 
 in wikipedia i don't think it's right 
 but anyway so basically it's the people 
 who will deal with 
 with 
 sorry data privacy and so the they 
 released this thing if you're not french 
 speaker this is a really long title but 
 basically it is some 
 recommendation 
 for 
 online voting so what you should if you 
 want to make a 
 online voting what you should or should 
 not do and basically what they say is 
 they are not really 
 they don't say it's uh it's the best 
 idea to do uh 
 to do online voting for political 
 election 
 and uh the most important part of this 
 thing it's it's only a recommendation so 
 basically to the kneel say yeah you 
 should do that but if you don't do that 
 there is no legal implicat implication 
 uh so basically it means that if you 
 want to make online voting in france uh 
 there is 
 for what i understand there is no legal 
 obligation of anything you can just 
 develop your software and it's okay 
 uh so now we are going to talk about a 
 company which is called novot this call 
 is this company is basically the main 
 actor in uh in france for online voting 
 so they i guess they got 
 a lot of clients with kobe 19 because 
 plenty of people now want to vote 
 online 
 they work 
 for the university plenty of company etc 
 and uh yeah sorry uh the 
 they have 
 used the software has been used for the 
 political election for the the primary 
 party election 
 so that's when i start knowing them uh 
 so if we talk about the solution the 
 software uh the main issue with the 
 software is it's a through black box so 
 there is no documentation no white paper 
 nothing 
 what you see here is basically the only 
 thing on the website which talk 
 a bit about what they do but it's the 
 only thing you have so it's very few 
 of course you cannot see the source code 
 and as i said yeah there is a multiple 
 primary party we hold 
 some 
 primary election 
 and uh so 
 all those elections were done with uh 
 neovat on internet 
 uh yeah so spoiler alert uh 
 i voted for the green party and so i got 
 interesting in the thing and so i 
 started the uh the software how it works 
 etc and so i wanted to write an article 
 i talked about all my finding to neobot 
 they consider it wasn't a real finding 
 and 
 yeah i just was nagging about the thing 
 that i didn't 
 find anything interesting 
 so anyway i met 
 anka blanchard which is a 
 french researcher she works at cnrs and 
 so 
 together with 
 joy and juliet we wrote a paper that got 
 raised last month in in conference in 
 france 
 and so nervous 
 don't seem to be really happy about it 
 because they tried to 
 to cancel the talk at the conference 
 with a legal action 
 so that didn't work but uh yeah 
 anyway so i have to to be faster because 
 otherwise uh you won't see the fun part 
 so i voted for i set for the primary for 
 the green party so basically how it 
 works you you you go on the website you 
 you do some stuff like you choose a 
 password then you go on the website for 
 voting and you use your cell phone with 
 pin code for vote etc i won't go in 
 detail if you're more interested in this 
 thing there is another talk another 
 paper sorry about that it's in french if 
 you don't read french sorry 
 so at the end of the voting you have 
 this thing which uh so it's um 
 the last screen which said oh you voted 
 uh so we have a really wide screen so 
 when i took the screenshot yeah that's 
 it 
 and so if you don't see there is this 
 weird thing at the middle which is a bit 
 uh red orange uh which they called uh 
 proof of vote and so they said okay you 
 voted and now there is this proof of 
 vote keep it it's personal if you want 
 to check that you've bought i've been uh 
 re is in inside the ballot box 
 everything is right you should use that 
 so okay but 
 uh there was not much information about 
 that so i asked niobot how it works and 
 they told me that you have to wait for 
 the end of the election and then you 
 will have the stuff so i went for the 
 end of the election 
 and then here's the results screen from 
 the end of the election and you see 
 there is a this you so they give you a 
 website and they say okay you can verify 
 your 
 your vote going to this website and 
 using this password 
 uh so the website is here so it's a 
 different website 
 uh on the website you put the address of 
 the the server you voted on uh you put 
 the password you put your proof of vote 
 and after that you you hit validate and 
 it crashed 
 sorry so yeah it crashed and 
 in fact it time out and so you have to 
 retry and then retry and then retry and 
 after some 
 it finally works and so here you have 
 the thing so they say 
 everything is fine the green box is 
 saying yeah your proof of vote proof of 
 vote is working and if you see the 
 results it's the same that on wikipedia 
 it's the official one so okay everything 
 fine 
 uh yeah there is one thing funny that i 
 saw when i did that is there is 
 this link for the source code so i click 
 it i got a php script which is a source 
 code and so it's really great because it 
 means that you can run the source code 
 the php script on your own computer you 
 don't have to trust the website for 
 doing the check so yeah good 
 um 
 so here is an example sorry the the code 
 is uh copyrighted i guess so i cannot 
 show everything but i can show the 
 little extract the script is like a four 
 thousand five hundred lines uh and so 
 here is uh for instance the code for the 
 error handling for the error we saw uh 
 so we have uh the ballot counting about 
 counting take a lot of time because 
 there is encryption etc whatever so we 
 have this written code if the written 
 code is 98 then you store the stuff on 
 the cache and then you have this return 
 code which is a one an error point which 
 in 40 plus written code divided by 1000 
 but if your case is two three five and 
 six but not four then error code is six 
 euro point twenty eight plus retail code 
 divided by 1000 and you have a break two 
 which is a ps3 instruction to say you 
 have to go outside of two loops 
 okay 
 fine enough 
 so now 
 what does this script do uh so it go it 
 goes on the website it download two 
 archives 
 uh it 
 decrypts this archive with the password 
 and then you check your 
 the proof of vote and it counts the 
 ballot okay so first thing we are going 
 to see is uh this proof of what what is 
 made of so here is typically the 
 proverbot it's a base64 of something 
 which is encrypted with aes 
 uh so symmetric encryption 
 uh yeah let's see secretary clinton 
 exclusion without code key 
 so the key is inside the script 
 uh i asked a newbot about that and they 
 say it's fine there is no security issue 
 because it's not for security it's for 
 padding uh so let's talk about padding 
 uh because you know aes it's what they 
 call uh block encryption 
 so block encryption means you encrypt 32 
 octet so two bytes a time and so if your 
 last part is not 30 too long what do you 
 do you do padding so 
 in aes there is this thing which is 
 called pkcs7 which do the 
 padding so the question is 
 why not using pkcs7 instead of using uh 
 just a s for doing the padding it would 
 be much more efficient and it won't look 
 suspicious as 
 showing an art credit key and anyway 
 what for because 
 the proof of what why it should have to 
 be this side we don't know because there 
 is no documentation and sorry anyway uh 
 all the data for all the generated 
 and proof of votes are all the same side 
 so 
 yet again anyway 
 uh so 
 what's inside this proof of vote 
 it's five shar 512 ashes so 
 each one of them are for one vote so 
 there is like five votes in this vote 
 uh so why is it so what is it for that 
 it's because 
 the id is what i told you before uh when 
 you got one proof of what you shouldn't 
 be able to show for who you voted for so 
 there is your vote inside the approval 
 vote and four other votes so you should 
 not be able to save for who you voted 
 for 
 uh you know the funny thing is of course 
 there is no crypto signature which means 
 we can 
 uh we can do funny stuff i'm going to 
 see so anyway uh the format just really 
 fast as you see uh on the 
 cursor yeah here you have uh 
 all the the ashes you have some random 
 parts the header and so the idea is they 
 do crc so 
 redundancy control so they do a checksum 
 and so for doing this checksum they use 
 this 
 this variable this constant which is 
 called a paper and the funny thing is 
 they concatenate it 
 and it's php so maybe you don't see but 
 this is a string but this is bytes in 
 fact and so this looks like a 
 hexadecimal 
 string but it's used directly here as 
 bytes 
 so that concatenate bytes which only 
 contain exactly small characters 
 it's a bit weird but i think there's 
 forget something here 
 uh anyway so you have your redundancy 
 control you concatenate with the rest of 
 the thing you do the aes and you know 
 you got your proof of vote so it's 
 really simple so of course you can write 
 a fake proof of both script so here is 
 mine because it's a python conference so 
 you should see some python 
 so here you see i just generated a 
 random sha 512 screw ashes 
 and so if you do this you go on the 
 website and uh it doesn't work well i 
 mean 
 the the neovat website says your proof 
 of what is 
 wrong 
 so so far so good i mean maybe we don't 
 go really far with this but in fact we 
 do 
 because 
 what we are doing here is we are 
 provided a fake proof of vote and we are 
 checking it against the genuine ballot 
 box 
 but neovat has no way to know if it's 
 not the other way around maybe we have a 
 genuine a real proof of vote and the 
 ballot box has been tempered and on the 
 two side it's always the same check that 
 is done and there is no way to know 
 which one is which so what does it mean 
 is anyone can generate a 
 proof of vote 
 and claim that his proof of vote doesn't 
 check with the ballot box and hence the 
 election was rigged 
 and 
 the other funny thing is anyone with a 
 valid proof of vote who sees the 
 organizer saying oh my proof-of-work 
 doesn't work something is fishy 
 the organizer can tell them you're the 
 one who generate a fake proof of vote 
 you fake news 
 anyway 
 so now for a real case studies uh green 
 party election there was a the person 
 who arrived last he really couldn't 
 believe it so he said 
 this is not right the election might 
 have been rigged and so he went to 
 justice for for this 
 and uh 
 yeah 
 nothing could be proved so uh yeah i 
 just just lost his thing 
 the funny thing is uh so there is this 
 quote from a 
 researcher which is called chantal anger 
 which is specialized in electronic 
 voting and 
 so the idea is the electronic voting 
 industry basically what they said is 
 electronic voting works great because 
 nobody ever say that there is an 
 electoral dispute there is issue and why 
 is it so it's simple because there is no 
 way to prove there is something which 
 went wrong 
 so if you have physical evidence of the 
 votes it's much simpler to show 
 something fishy is than if everything 
 happened on a computer 
 uh so anyway now we are going to see the 
 voting website i showed you before so 
 basically it's like every uh website so 
 it's minified it's uh it's like that 
 anyway so you can un 
 unminified it 
 and uh you have all those variables you 
 see that there are weird names that get 
 changed every time you reload the page 
 okay but 
 some of them are not 
 minified are not really well named they 
 stay there so we can do a bit of google 
 search and github search and then we 
 find a library which is called asm 
 crypto 
 so it might be the one they use in the 
 website and it is of course 
 uh here you can see asm crypto on the 
 one side the code from neobot on the 
 other so it's pretty similar 
 uh now for the 
 bad news is a asm scriptor hasn't been 
 modified since september 2020 
 of course there is no security audit so 
 it doesn't seem the best library to do a 
 really sensitive thing 
 uh but there is one thing that doesn't 
 add up it's uh as we will see new what 
 use uh one type of encryption which is a 
 areas uh pcs blah blah blah anyway and 
 this 
 precise uh algorithm is not supported by 
 asm crypto the library so 
 they don't use 
 asm crypto they use and unmerge pull 
 requests of asm crypto 
 so here is for instance one part of the 
 code so 
 same thing you see the neovote code the 
 asm cryptopoloquest and so same code 
 so let's talk a bit about nc so nc in 
 france is uh the the people which are 
 responsible to say uh what you should 
 and should not do in terms of computing 
 security so there are really really 
 great guy 
 who give really good advice when they 
 say something you should listen to them 
 and what they say is you must really 
 please use mature library libraries that 
 have written by experts and you use 
 library with security support it's 
 really important because it's really 
 simple to have something which is broken 
 in security in cryptography that you 
 don't know that is broken 
 so anyway let's talk about the ballot 
 box format 
 as you saw in the in the result page 
 so the website you put it for there is 
 this password that is provided 
 and so with the password you're supposed 
 to decrypt the 
 the two archive one is the ballot box 
 and the another is ballot key and if you 
 decrypt the ballot key on windows there 
 is an error if you better if you decrypt 
 the not bullet key but box on linux 
 there is an error so why is it so 
 someone knows 
 little advice 
 tip yeah 
 do you see it 
 do you see it 
 okay yeah of course so yeah uh the the 
 trouble is uh if you if you use your 
 archive is a zip format on zip format 
 they don't specif they don't specify 
 what will be the encoding so if you use 
 a unicode character the encoding the 
 plan of your system if your line locks 
 it will be utf-8 if you're on windows it 
 most likely will be iso and so yeah it's 
 it's not great 
 anyway the php script he has to open 
 both archives so how does it work 
 they try 
 they try to put encryption on top of it 
 and they try to put the other encryption 
 i mean sorry the other encoding on top 
 of it and after three try they should be 
 fine enough 
 so 
 yeah 
 i wouldn't have done that this way 
 especially if you control the generation 
 of the archive the reading of the 
 archive 
 yeah 
 anyway 
 uh so maybe you're thinking like oh it's 
 not big deal it's smoothing it's not 
 real security issue 
 so yeah but 
 it's not like that i mean 
 i was talking to you about the kneel and 
 the recommendation in the recommendation 
 what they say is it's important for 
 third-party people to be able to read 
 the ballot box it's important for 
 third-party people to write 
 independent software that could help 
 checking the ballot box and so basically 
 that's what i'm doing and uh 
 for the presidential election neo-vote 
 was used by 700 000 voters and basically 
 from what i understand i'm the only guy 
 watching uh writing a third-party tool 
 for this so 
 please can we have a like standard 
 format something that make it 
 simpler for people like me to write 
 things that check uh because on the all 
 the work i've done for sorry all the 
 work i've done here on this thing 
 this encoding issue is a thing that took 
 me the most time 
 so yeah it could have been really 
 avoided 
 please 
 anyway 
 so yeah uh one more thing i told you 
 first there was no absolutely no source 
 code from the obot and then i told you 
 there is this 
 little uh source code you can download 
 and it's because 
 yes since uh 
 last time i mean since the green party 
 election and since i've sent them 
 the fact that all the the finding i had 
 they removed the the possibility to 
 download the code 
 great 
 transparency 
 anyway what's in the archive so there is 
 this first archive which is about key 
 export 
 which contain rsa 
 key so private key for doing decryption 
 the file is a dot pm which is a standard 
 format for aes key but it doesn't 
 contain pm key 
 so a little discretion what is pm 
 when you want to store so basically uh 
 in rsa your key your key is a really big 
 number if you want to store it you saw 
 it in the format or in the format 
 uh so which is called asn one so okay 
 anyway and this format you anchored it 
 inside in a binary format which is 
 called the year 
 but given this format is a binary it's 
 not really convenient so basically what 
 you do is you put a header you put a 
 footer you do a base64 encoding and here 
 is this you've got your pm key and what 
 neovote does is they add another layer 
 of base64 encoding because why not and 
 so it makes things a bit more 
 complicated for me for people like me 
 writing software tools anyway 
 uh so next thing what's in the archive 
 you have uh so this is the other archive 
 the ballot box export one 
 uh what you have here is uh multiple 
 files which are 
 not really interesting like the name of 
 the election something like that and you 
 have those two folders each folder is a 
 round of the election so this election 
 there was two rounds that was there 
 that's why there is two folders 
 if we have a look at what's inside one 
 of the folder there is this thing which 
 is this file which is called the object 
 names which contain 
 the id of each candidate and the name of 
 the candidate so you see here is the 
 second round so there is a two candidate 
 and the the white vote 
 uh and after that there is this comp 
 param which is another file which 
 contains the type of election 
 if it's if you have to vote for one 
 person or multiple person 
 and finally there is a 
 more interesting 
 part which is this third file which is 
 called bad data and it contained one 
 line per vote that happened and uh we're 
 going to see what it contained so what 
 you see here is there is the first part 
 and the second part is a sha 512 of the 
 third part so the second part is the 
 thing we saw in the 
 in the proof of vote 
 the first part 
 it's uh 
 rsa encrypted 
 and it contains 
 on the right side random things 
 and on the left side it contains the id 
 of the candidate which has been voted 
 for 
 now a little disagreeation because i 
 said the thing is encrypted with rsa but 
 you all know of course that you should 
 never do a 
 textbook essay so you should not just 
 use rsa you should always use rsa with 
 padding and so there is different type 
 of piping 
 and basically there is a new 
 shiny one which is orep and pss and 
 there is the older one which is called 
 pkcs1 which is used by neovot and what 
 say nc about this is basically it's 
 obsolete so you shouldn't use it for 
 newer software 
 okay 
 and so how does it works because yes you 
 have 
 when you encrypt something with rsa your 
 the thing you encrypt maybe the same 
 side of your key so in case here it's uh 
 37 to 72 bits 
 uh and so with pick a cs one you have a 
 header you have random stuff which is a 
 cryptographically secure random bytes 
 and you have your message your message 
 is what we saw the funny thing is uh the 
 thing on the right which is supposed to 
 be 
 random 
 it's not cryptographically secure it's 
 just it's much less random that uh 
 cryptographically uh secure thing uh 
 it's easy to see this because here you 
 see 
 this is bytes still this is bias and you 
 see there is only printable characters 
 so basically what they do they get they 
 take 
 good randomly secure bites and they do 
 some kind of cooking to turn them into 
 something printable i don't know why 
 they need something printable but anyway 
 and so it makes things less 
 less random 
 so basically what they're doing is 
 they're replacing 
 this 
 cryptographically secure random bytes 
 from 
 the pcs padding by something which is 
 less random 
 i don't know why they do this but 
 not a great great idea i guess 
 but it's not a security issue because 
 picacios is well made and there must be 
 at the very least eight 
 cryptographically secure random bytes 
 but anyway 
 it's still weird 
 oh i'm already there 
 i know i can start to slow down 
 because uh i thought it would be much 
 faster it was slower anyway 
 uh so we are going to to have a bit of 
 fun 
 so 
 the 
 the ballot box 
 we saw there is no signature on it 
 uh we also saw that they gave us the rsa 
 private key to do the decryption 
 uh we know all the vote ashes because 
 they are inside the 
 ballot box and there are the ones which 
 are used inside the proof of vote the 
 so-called proof of vote 
 so we can try to 
 to tamper with the ballot box 
 uh yeah so first thing we can do 
 is you know there is this file which is 
 called object name where we saw 
 with the id of the candidate and the 
 name of the candidate so 
 really basic thing we can do is just 
 modify this file so we 
 switch the name and we saw what happened 
 and so if we generate a new ballot box 
 and we uh provide it to the official 
 website that do the check and you use 
 the 
 proof of vote 
 regular one you see that everything is 
 considered as valid so 
 it's fine except that now it's a wrong 
 candidate that's a one 
 so it's a really really basic attack but 
 it works and so 
 the thing is the the very practical 
 thing about this attack is 
 you don't have to be a computing 
 engineer you don't have to do fancy 
 thing you just have to open a zip 
 archive modify two names close the zip 
 archive and that's it you're done so 
 it's really incredible incredibly simple 
 to do that if you're a voter it's really 
 hard to see 
 that something wrong went because you 
 have your proof of word but remember the 
 proof of it doesn't contain only 
 the the vote for who you voted for it 
 contains also other votes so 
 you cannot see that 
 you voted for the wrong person because 
 the id has been switched 
 i guess it's not 
 really practical because what nilvot can 
 do is uh take this file which is uh the 
 file containing uh the the link between 
 the id and the name of the candidate and 
 they can just share it and 
 share it before the election with all 
 the different parties say okay this id 
 is going to be this candidate so if you 
 do that it's really simple to see that 
 there is a switch that happened i don't 
 know if they either do any check but i 
 suppose they do because 
 there is no documentation about what 
 they do of course 
 so let's try something a bit more 
 complicated 
 which is uh 
 given we have the private key the 
 private rsa key we also have the public 
 one 
 and so if we have the public rsa key we 
 can do encryption and so we can start 
 encrypting our own new ballot we can 
 generate new ballot as much as we want 
 so uh yeah we just have your our ballot 
 box our archive and we put plenty of new 
 ballot box just enough so that 
 there is a difference of one vote before 
 between the two candidates and so now 
 the wrong candidate has win 
 so it works again 
 of course this attack is much more 
 visible because 
 the issue as we saw here is 
 the number of ballots has changed 
 because we have generated plenty of new 
 ballots so if you look at all the people 
 that were supposed to vote and all the 
 ballots at the end you see the number is 
 different so it's really easy to spot 
 it's a funny attack and now for the the 
 third attack there is this file of 
 course you saw it of course you were 
 wondering what it was and we are going 
 to talk about this file so the name is 
 extra ashes 
 uh what does this file do it's simple uh 
 when the script is checking for the the 
 ashes in your proof of vote first thing 
 you do is go inside this file and it 
 removes 
 the the ashes from your proof of vote 
 which are inside this file so basically 
 this file is saying okay this this uh 
 ashes yeah don't don't take care don't 
 care about it just just drop it 
 uh so my guess is why they do this is 
 because 
 when you are the very first person that 
 go to vote 
 uh 
 on the nearby server there is no other 
 vote but nova terror has to send you 
 back your the five ash 
 the five ashes to generate the proof of 
 vote and so what the new what server 
 does is generate four random ashes store 
 them in extra ashes and so return you 
 the ashes 
 anyway so the funny thing is now what 
 can we do is generate a fake ballot like 
 we do in the second attack we put the 
 fake ballot inside the file with all the 
 ballots but now we have too much ballots 
 inside the file so we remove some of the 
 of the genuine 
 ballot from the ballot ballot box for 
 the data file 
 and all those um 
 all those ballots that have been removed 
 you can take their their ashes and you 
 put the ashes inside the extra ashy.csv 
 file i mean 
 there was 24 
 there was 24 ashes in extra ashes 
 now there is something like five 
 thousand or ten thousand what's the 
 difference 
 who knows 
 but the good thing is now you you 
 totally uh change the result of the 
 election 
 so everything's fine now 
 still you have a difference of two votes 
 between the first and the second one and 
 uh yeah everything is fine because you 
 have the right name of vote 
 you have checked everything everybody 
 has a valid proof of vote 
 uh 
 everything appears like 
 it should but the only difference is you 
 have too much uh ashes in extra hashes 
 but nobody knows what this file does so 
 we can say it's wrong or right to have 5 
 7 or 24 
 anyway 
 yeah so as i said 
 all the votes all the proof of vote are 
 valid 
 if you are an organizer you you just 
 cannot 
 know that if this attack if this attack 
 happened you cannot have any way to 
 check 
 so yeah 
 if you wonder of course 
 given uh i give those information to 
 neovat they answered 
 they say that 
 all my attack are not i'm not adding the 
 official near what server of course i'm 
 doing this stuff on local on my computer 
 i write my scripts 
 and so they said 
 it's misleading what i'm saying because 
 i could not change the result of the 
 election because 
 i could only change the file on my 
 computer and the only 
 source of truth is the archive which is 
 on the the website on the voting website 
 which is hosted by neovote 
 so 
 i'm totally agree with them on this 
 what does it mean is as long as you 
 trust the archive that is on the nearby 
 server 
 then the transparency script that you 
 should run not to trust neovote is 
 working fine 
 fair enough 
 uh yeah so 
 i have time we can say 
 what we saw today so there is this uh 
 string versus byte 
 just mismanagement that remember us when 
 we were doing python 2 
 but 
 2021 2022 now 
 uh anyway there is this encoding issue 
 there is this uh 
 symmetric encryption used as padding 
 stuff 
 uh this uh random 
 bytes which are not cryptographically 
 secure random bytes which but which are 
 added for god knows why 
 the use of legacy padding 
 of course my favorite one the use of asm 
 crypto 
 pull request for doing uh cryptography 
 uh 
 and the fact that 
 we saw that when you do the 
 the ballot box as a proof of vote 
 checking on the website the website 
 crashes but why it crashes it's because 
 you have a lot a lot a lot of erisa 
 decryption to do 
 and uh it's costly but what it means if 
 if you are in an election like uh 
 what is what i show an election with 
 like 100 thousand people if you have one 
 people that want to check his vote the 
 website is already down 
 so 
 it's like 
 people there are suppose i mean you give 
 them two to say oh you should check your 
 your vote but if they try to do it 
 things are crashing if you are not 
 working great 
 for instance in in the green party they 
 were talking about this proof of vote 
 and where you can do the check for the 
 next election for the 
 the left-wing party a pre-primary party 
 election 
 they didn't talk at all about this 
 voting proof the effect the fact you can 
 check on the website so when you end up 
 voting they say oh you can check your 
 vote at the end with this thing and 
 after that at the end of the election 
 they don't give any information where 
 you can do the check 
 and nobody seems to complain because 
 nobody understands how online voting 
 works 
 so 
 it's not really great for from us 
 yeah 
 so anyway if you're curious and you want 
 to see a mickey mouse uh win the 
 election you can trade yourself i have 
 put everything on github 
 so you can just download the box uh try 
 change the thing 
 you can check against 
 the real 
 verify website 
 as you can see i had to change the 
 password from the original archive 
 because 
 i couldn't in python 
 put 
 the right password with all this 
 anchoring weirdness and because the zip 
 module in python doesn't support 
 encrypted archive 
 anyway so i talked to you about uh the 
 cnrs publication in uh in algotel uh if 
 you're 
 french speaking it's great but if you're 
 an english speaker it's not great but 
 don't worry there is a new conference 
 coming which is in austria and there is 
 a paper and this paper is in english and 
 if you want to to write the 
 anonymized preprint you can it's still 
 done by 
 encar 
 which have done an incredible job on 
 this 
 so if you're austrian you should check 
 it 
 and i think i'm done 
 yeah 
 thank you very much amalia for this very 
 interesting talk 
 and it's always great to see that 
 somebody looks at the security and then 
 is just surprised and presents this to 
 us because normally you would just trust 
 these systems or just expect them to be 
 trustworthy without having to check it 
 yourself we have time for some questions 
 so is other questions from the audience 
 if you have a question about the 
 security of the 
 online voting you can get quickly to the 
 microphone here in front 
 and ask a question i see somebody 
 already coming 
 so 
 hello please ask your question 
 hi thank you for the very informative 
 talk i was just interested did you 
 manage to 
 gain interest for some like interested 
 actors like from the 
 uh 
 i don't know i don't want to say 
 government but people who are in charge 
 actually of making such systems 
 uh yeah so as i told you uh from uh from 
 what i understand from a 
 legal point of view uh 
 what nirvat is doing is fine i mean 
 there cannot be 
 don't quote of me on this because i'm 
 basically the man in the street when i'm 
 seeing that but what i understand is 
 they cannot be a suit or anything for 
 what they're doing i guess 
 but 
 anyway i think my findings are 
 interesting so 
 i send them to neobot so they can react 
 and after that because they didn't react 
 i send also them to the kneel i talked 
 to you about and the nc so the guy which 
 are responsible to say what you should 
 and shouldn't do in security 
 so now they know 
 they do something or not it's uh what 
 they want 
 uh and anyway we are doing a publication 
 with the with the cnrs with anchor so 
 that's the most we can do 
 thank you thank you very much the next 
 question please 
 hi thanks for the interesting talk i 
 just wanted to ask a simple question and 
 what is your background what did you 
 study to be able to understand all of 
 this 
 so 
 i'm mostly doing uh 
 software development uh and what i do is 
 uh what i show you on the very first 
 slide that you should go check 
 anyway uh so it's like i'm using crypto 
 but i'm not a mathematician i'm not 
 developing crypto i stay as far away as 
 i can from crypto because i just want to 
 have a well thought api like if you do 
 crypto you should use a 
 lip sodium if you know it it's a 
 basically the good way to do crypto and 
 so i'm just a regular computing engineer 
 i'm just curious and uh so you you saw 
 on the pi on the on the page when you 
 check the the votes there was you can 
 download the source card so you get 
 triggers you download you read the code 
 you say um i could uh 
 and then you just follow the flow of the 
 script and uh and you see what happened 
 and the sad thing about that is as i saw 
 now they removed the download the source 
 code so imagine if the from the 
 beginning haven't put this download 
 source code 
 i would not be here talking about this 
 they could get away with it i mean 
 all the all the things that's 
 inside this conference 
 nobody we could know because everything 
 is closed 
 thanks 
 our next question please 
 hello thanks for the talk it was really 
 really cool to see that 
 i'm french too so i can relate 
 do you know of any 
 trustworthy state-of-the-art system that 
 could 
 be trusted by government and citizens 
 from online voting and which is 
 hopefully open source and transparent 
 and everything uh 
 yeah 
 basically i mean basically uh when 
 you're talking about online voting you 
 already 
 i mean you're already too far if you 
 want to do voting 
 i mean there is two ways to do voting 
 there is one way which is 
 you care about 
 secrecy and then you have to do physical 
 voting and the other thing is you don't 
 care about secrecy 
 i mean it's possible if you if you're 
 voting for something that is not really 
 important you can say okay let's vote 
 and we can all be clear about it we just 
 raise the hand or we vote online 
 on the poll software or anything i mean 
 it's a it's a legitimate use case and at 
 least uh it's really clear that the 
 thing is open 
 uh 
 if you do online voting it's like of a 
 grayish thing 
 so for instance i was talking about one 
 researcher 
 chantal anger she she does a lot of 
 research on this thing and what i 
 understood she told me 
 uh 
 i understood that so i'm not an expert 
 is 
 when there is a switch 
 people were using physical 
 physical voting and then the switch for 
 online or electronic voting 
 people are not voting the same there is 
 more people voting before that when you 
 have to do something physical maybe 
 people are lazy they don't go 
 there there are more people voting uh 
 most of the time it's because even if 
 it's electronic voting people have to go 
 to the company to vote so of course you 
 don't say oh no i'm not going 
 i'm going to have a cigarette no you go 
 with everybody 
 and the other thing is 
 when they vote they vote differently 
 because 
 when you are in a company 
 and you have 
 you have your political opinion so you 
 want to vote for something but you know 
 the the election is held by the company 
 and you don't know how much you can 
 trust the computer the software et 
 cetera et cetera and start you start by 
 uh going a bit like yeah 
 yeah maybe it's just easier to to temper 
 a bit what i think and 
 be sure i won't lose my job something 
 like that 
 so yeah if you want to do good voting 
 just do physical voting 
 okay we have time for one quick more 
 question could you please ask a question 
 hi uh great talk thanks uh quick 
 question i'm a data engineer so in my 
 job i have access to really big 
 databases i see your personal data yeah 
 and my company trusts me not to do 
 anything illegal with it yeah or else i 
 go to jail 
 um 
 how much do you trust the new vote 
 developers 
 to you know respect an election and not 
 skew the votes is there any way to know 
 that the current people who 
 ran for the election did not did or did 
 not actually win 
 yeah your question is kind of the 
 the complete theory or something like 
 that 
 i would say that 
 as long as there is no proof 
 you don't have to 
 you don't want to put a shadow and say 
 yeah they may be doing the maybe not no 
 i mean 
 what i believe is they're honest 
 they don't want to to temper the 
 election and uh it would be really 
 foolish to do that of course because 
 it's not i mean they are making money 
 with this software so they don't want to 
 to kill uh the milking co 
 uh so i'm pretty sure they are doing 
 an honest job they don't try to change 
 things or anything but uh it's not i 
 mean there is so many layers so many 
 different people who can do something i 
 mean if tomorrow uh 
 there is a i don't know insert a big 
 country with hackers that understand 
 that there is this software which is 
 more and more used for do for doing 
 voting 
 uh maybe it's interesting to put enough 
 energy in hacking this thing and they go 
 inside the server and uh 
 they understand how to 
 rewrite the zip archive with these 
 encoding issues 
 to change the world about box and now 
 they've changed the election and no one 
 can know anything about it or maybe 
 later on you realize that oh this 
 election there was a hacking things and 
 maybe the alexander the result has 
 changed 
 and what can you do or maybe there is 
 nothing that happened i mean everything 
 is fine but just you have a like a 
 donald trump as i said the election is 
 rigged 
 and uh how can you prove that action is 
 not rigged even everything is done on a 
 computer you don't have a lot of 
 physical evidence 
 so 
 even if every everybody is perfectly 
 honest it's still an issue 
 thank you okay thank you very much for 
 all the questions and thanks again for 
 the talk so let's have another round of 
 applause emmanuel 
 and we will stop the talks in this room 
 now uh until the lunch is over and then 
 the talks will conclude 
 bank of america mainly here as a 
 recruitment drive we have you know 
 plenty of open roles in the python space 
 both in core app development django 
 flask and 
 uh and across full stack as well 
 in terms of doing something special for 
 the attendees we have a really 
 interesting speaker this year in terms 
 of nile o'connor talking about asset 
 price reversals um 
 uh without the normal swag and uh 
 special gifts for people and we'll be 
 doing some some raffles and giveaways um 
 and if there's anyone who wants to talk 
 to us at the at the desk we're here all 
 through the conference i guess we chose 
 european because a it's in dublin and 
 it's the first time since peak overtimes 
 i've been able to get people together 
 and really you know promote what we do 
 in in bank america in terms of python 
 you know it's a very much 
 a python focused uh conference which is 
 really where our tech stack lies and 
 where a lot of our projects are within 
 bank of america 
 so hi my name is marianne shine and i'm 
 the head of hr and operations with 
 umnitza in ireland 
 so this is umnitz's first year to 
 sponsor euro python we're so excited to 
 celebrate this year and participate in 
 europe python coming to ireland so 
 umnitza is a u.s company with our r d 
 based in galway in the west of ireland 
 we have employees all over ireland and 
 we thought this would be a great 
 opportunity to bring them along today 
 and participate 
 in the ecosystem the the python 
 ecosystem and really learn from 
 other professionals within this area 
 this year we're actually sponsoring the 
 pi ladies lunch so umitza are very 
 passionate about gender diversity within 
 our engineering team in galway we 
 currently have 33 
 um females in our team 
 and so we're very privileged and honored 
 to sponsor the pie ladies lunch which i 
 think is taking place on friday so we're 
 very excited to be here i think europe 
 python is a very unique conference 
 and because i think it 
 brings people who are passionate about 
 python together 
 and really gives them the opportunity to 
 learn about the most progressive 
 practices within python and also 
 leverage the wider 
 python ecosystem

 in my team execution research everything 
 starts from data 
 after getting the data we do our 
 research and analysis on this data to 
 test our ideas 
 and then finally we have to get it in an 
 output format such that trading or 
 trading strategies can pick this up and 
 this whole workflow almost exclusively 
 works in python 
 [Music] 
 working in a company that has 
 aspirations to be the best at what they 
 do that's what drives people solving 
 problems and having the best people with 
 you trying to solve those problems you 
 can't beat that 
 there are people who are actually able 
 to not only look at the data and 
 understand it but analyze it and express 
 it in a way that others understand 
 and that's i suppose that's the gift of 
 a great storyteller 
 [Music] 
 um 
 uh we're here 
 at microsoft and we have been sponsoring 
 era python for i believe four years now 
 it's been some time and we're excited to 
 be back here this year yeah so for euro 
 python this year 
 our team has a few talks uh lined up for 
 some of the attendees so we're doing 
 that and we also have some cool swag and 
 stickers for all the attendees as well 
 some of them might be limited edition 
 we'll see 
 and we absolutely love europe python 
 because of the community uh the european 
 community is amazing and we love being 
 able to see them in hearing person get 
 this just this connection that we nor we 
 can't have virtually but it's always not 
 the same in person is always like that 
 really great conversations and we get 
 like 
 great feedback from our users as well 
 but most importantly it's the 
 conversations about how much we love 
 python all the amazing things we do 
 with this like the european um community 
 so we're a brand new sponsor for uh for 
 european this year bank of america 
 mainly here as a recruitment drive we 
 have you know plenty of open roles in 
 the python space 
 both in core app development django 
 flask and 
 uh and across full stack as well 
 in terms of doing something special for 
 the attendees we have a really 
 interesting speaker this year in terms 
 of nine o'clock talking about asset 
 price reversals um 
 we'll have the normal swag and uh 
 special gifts for people and we'll be 
 doing some some raffles and giveaways um 
 and if there's anyone who wants to talk 
 to us at the desk we're here all through 
 the conference i guess we chose european 
 because a it's in dublin and it's the

 so in my team execution research 
 everything starts from data 
 after getting the data we do our 
 research and analysis on this data to 
 test our ideas 
 and then finally we have to get it in an 
 output format such that trading or 
 trading strategies can pick this up and 
 this whole workflow almost exclusively 
 works in python 
 working in a company that has 
 aspirations to be the best at what they 
 do that's what drives people solving 
 problems and having the best people with 
 you trying to solve those problems you 
 can't beat that 
 there are people who are actually able 
 to not only look at the data and 
 understand it but analyze it and express 
 it in a way that others understand 
 and that's i suppose that's the gift of 
 a great storyteller 
 so

 so in my team execution research 
 everything starts from data 
 after getting the data we do our 
 research and analysis on this data to 
 test our ideas and then finally we have 
 to get it in an output format such that 
 trading or trading strategies can pick 
 this up and this whole workflow almost 
 exclusively works in python 
 working in a company that has 
 aspirations to be the best at what they 
 do that's what drives people solving 
 problems and having the best people with 
 you trying to solve those problems you 
 can't beat that 
 there are people who are actually able 
 to not only look at the data and 
 understand it but analyze it and express 
 it in a way that others understand 
 and that's i suppose that's the gift of 
 a great storyteller

 let's actually start with our remote 
 guest 
 uh so go ahead 
 hi everybody and um yeah so uh greetings 
 to uh dublin i'm tuning in from hamburg 
 germany 
 and i was supposed to be there but you 
 know i got i decided to go for the 
 famous virus um or infamous yeah so 
 my name is teresa teresa 
 i'm a part of the hamburg python 
 community and high ladies 
 and i've been with 
 working in the diversity and inclusion 
 space of 
 python community for quite a while now 
 so i joined um the 
 psf diversity inclusion work group two 
 years ago and also um i'm part of the 
 code of conduct work group with the psf 
 and recently the diversity diversity 
 inclusion in scientific computer 
 computing um 
 [Music] 
 committee so yeah that's about me and 
 passing on 
 thank you naomi 
 i'm molly 
 hi everyone um my name is marlene 
 mangami and i am a python developer from 
 zimbabwe 
 i 
 am part of diversity inclusion in terms 
 of the fact that i'm the 
 current chair of the psas diversity 
 inclusion work group 
 i also just in general i'm really 
 passionate about diversity and inclusion 
 mainly from the perspective of 
 geogra geographical diversity and 
 inclusion i'm from 
 like i mentioned before i'm from 
 zimbabwe and i am the previous chair 
 of pike on africa um 
 and an outgoing vice chair of the psaf 
 so um really interested in having 
 africans and other 
 you know not just africans but 
 python people from across the world 
 represented and have 
 having a space within the python 
 community so yeah that's me 
 hi folks my name is iqbal abdullah i'm 
 a malaysian by birth but i reside in 
 japan tokyo for the past 
 over 21 years 
 um i was 
 the founder 
 an organizer for pycon japan and also 
 pycon malaysia and currently i'm helping 
 around managing the regional pycon apac 
 which i hope to 
 pitch to you folks in one of our lts we 
 are going to have it in september 
 but that's going to be for the lts 
 in the context of the psf in general i'm 
 currently now affiliated with the dni 
 work group which is chaired by marlene 
 and also the trademarks worth group 
 which is called chat by david merks and 
 also 
 mark andre lumber 
 diversity and inclusion 
 on a 
 personal point of view so i cannot speak 
 for 
 my compatriots from the apec region but 
 on personal point of view 
 is actually sharing a common set of 
 values that is beneficial to the 
 community regardless of where or how you 
 come from or how you look like 
 hi everyone my name is nabanita roy i am 
 a data scientist at aci worldwide and 
 i've been residing in ireland for about 
 the last 
 about five years now 
 um i work with women in ai ireland 
 their education lead i 
 try to 
 build programs that 
 that help women and also men and anybody 
 who wants to really 
 skill up in the realm of ai wants to get 
 a taste of um how it is like to work 
 with python and the different tools um 
 about data science analytics 
 help them out build programs that 
 support these uh people 
 and 
 uh and diversity and inclusion really 
 excites me um and really you know great 
 to hear all the introductions here um 
 and great to know these people who work 
 in this realm as well 
 and it it's important um to me as well 
 um and it's 
 and i 
 really don't like to associate it with 
 like different individual work groups 
 but um i like 
 to 
 address diversity inclusion for anybody 
 who feels inferior to step up to 
 whatever to do whatever they want 
 and 
 basically just be free from all the 
 stereotypes 
 no thank you thank you i the first thing 
 we're going to do since we do have some 
 members of the psf diversity inclusion 
 work group is just have a little sketch 
 of what that is 
 because maybe many of you weren't aware 
 that it existed or don't know what it 
 does so for that i think we're going to 
 start with marlene and then after that 
 other people will kind of add what they 
 might 
 great thank you 
 um so the diversity and inclusion work 
 group is a group 
 that is sort of part of the psf for 
 coming out of the psf 
 and the goal is to further the psf's 
 mission to 
 make sure the python community is as 
 international and as diverse and 
 welcoming as possible 
 um so our goal as the diversity and 
 inclusion work group is just to make 
 sure that continues happening and in a 
 more i would say strategic and 
 intentional way 
 um and you know just some background in 
 terms of where this came from is that 
 um for those of you who don't know 
 python is a very popular programming 
 language and python is being used on 
 every single continent in the world it 
 is being used by over 10 million people 
 globally 
 but when we look at the leadership of 
 python 
 whether that is in our core development 
 team 
 or when we look at the board of 
 directors we don't see the uh diversity 
 of the users represented in that 
 leadership 
 and so 
 this kind of the the diversity and 
 inclusion work group actually came about 
 when 
 the psf which is the non-profit behind 
 python had uh some elections in in 2020 
 actually in 2020 
 a great year for all of us but 
 um 
 in 2020 what happened was 
 uh 
 several people ran for the board of 
 directors and in that year i i think 
 most of the people that made it onto the 
 board of directors were from north 
 america and and europe and even 
 currently right now there are you know 
 13 
 12 13 directors on the board of 
 directors for the psaf and out of those 
 13 only two of those people are not from 
 europe or north america and when you put 
 that in the context of the fact that 
 the python language is being used by 
 over 10 million people across the world 
 it shows that there's some disparity 
 there and there's you know a lack of 
 representation 
 um 
 so 
 there was in in 2020 there was some sort 
 of community discussion where a lot of 
 people didn't think that this was was 
 good 
 and and sort of voiced those concerns 
 the board got involved in those 
 discussion 
 um and the community was from different 
 parts of the world was very vocal um 
 about the thoughts thinking that that 
 was unfair and so the diversity 
 inclusion work group came out as a 
 result of that 
 and 
 currently 
 the work group has representatives from 
 every single continent around the world 
 with the exception of antarctica so i 
 have been asking if someone is from 
 antarctica please reach out to me 
 but 
 yeah so we want to make sure that we are 
 making the board or the community as 
 representative as welcoming two people 
 from all around the world and we're 
 starting with geographical 
 representation as our main focus for the 
 work group 
 so yeah that's a bit of a summary of of 
 what the diversity and inclusion work 
 group is about 
 okay any anyone want to add anything to 
 that 
 i think marlene summed it up very well 
 theresa do you have anything you want to 
 see 
 okay 
 well and and i do want to be clear that 
 this this session is not just about that 
 working group but we wanted to kind of 
 give you a little bit of background as 
 to that's where um some of our 
 experience uh comes from so 
 the first question that we have down for 
 for people to answer 
 uh would be um 
 what do you see 
 as the biggest challenge to increasing 
 diversity inclusion in python 
 communities and you kind of change 
 choose the scope is it locally 
 nationally globally whatever so 
 why don't you 
 go ahead okay 
 um 
 the biggest challenge uh 
 so 
 working on what marlene just mentioned 
 just now so 
 unfortunately i'm i'm using an example 
 by 
 the psf again but it also boils down to 
 that in a way 
 the diversity inclusion work group was 
 started because we wanted to address a 
 problem 
 whether it's a real or perceived problem 
 from different parts of the world of the 
 lack of 
 representation 
 and diversity in the leadership 
 and 
 the root cause from my point of view is 
 actually 
 the lack of involvement from the 
 community worldwide in choosing that 
 leadership 
 and this when we think about it so i've 
 done some discussions in my own 
 community it's it's uh 
 it's 
 uh what's the word for it the apathy so 
 i don't see how 
 this organization relates to me and how 
 it can better 
 my situation so i do not get myself 
 involved 
 and because of that we do not have the 
 so-called grassroots movements 
 grassroots movement to actually make the 
 change in the diversity itself because 
 people are not getting involved 
 so 
 at least in my part of the world that 
 seems to be 
 one of the hardest things to do because 
 you need to come down to the level a 
 very low level where you actually 
 convince people 
 and give them reasons why they need to 
 get involved in the first place and how 
 can it affect 
 your work or your livelihood of your 
 quality of life so that's from my 
 perspective okay thank you 
 um 
 i think 
 i'll talk from the ireland's perspective 
 and from what i've seen in women being 
 involved with women in ei for about two 
 and a half years now 
 um i think in the python community 
 um 
 or in the women in ei community there's 
 very less participation of the local 
 people 
 i think the most um percentage of the 
 group has 
 um participation from 
 different other place they're immigrant 
 they're not 
 basically from ireland 
 so 
 that's there's a disparity in the 
 motivation why do you want to you know 
 be involved with the community uh with 
 any community um 
 so once 
 um 
 you know 
 and there are some people who want to 
 uh take 
 away maybe 
 you know 
 a job 
 or some recognition and then that's it 
 for them 
 so 
 when the time comes when you actually 
 give back to the community 
 there's a gap there so i think 
 that has been a challenge retaining that 
 motivation 
 has been a challenge for us and then 
 growing a sense of oh you know 
 you've got what you've gotten but now 
 it's a time for you to transfer 
 motivate mentor more people to follow 
 your path really you know i think it's 
 it's been a challenge for us 
 here in in you know from the irish 
 background 
 thank you 
 teresa 
 thank you so yeah i think 
 um this is also happening in in germany 
 or in europe 
 but another issue i think is also that 
 most of everything that we do today is 
 in english 
 and 
 english is not the 
 main language of 
 everybody right so 
 um 
 and sometimes diversity and inclusion 
 means also tackling 
 um difficult topics that it's not really 
 easy to tackle in a language that is not 
 your own so i think 
 there's been quite a lot of effort in 
 the python community to translate 
 some of the documentation i think 
 spanish is almost done and but there are 
 so many other languages that 
 have a lot of 
 people 
 and 
 if you think about code of conduct or if 
 you think about 
 yeah even like documentation of how to 
 like people getting involved and 
 um 
 like 
 contributing to the ecosystem this is 
 currently mostly in english 
 and i think this is still 
 then it mostly feels foreign for a lot 
 of people 
 so i think that's actually quite a big 
 of a 
 that's quite a challenge that is not 
 really obvious to the people when we 
 speak when our english is quite fine 
 right 
 that is a big challenge in india as well 
 because i'm from india and you know it 
 has got a diverse city of languages so 
 sometimes you know you know i understand 
 that problem because not everyone knows 
 or is well spoken in english 
 and also understanding what somebody 
 else is saying some concepts are 
 difficult to understand 
 and i think many companies are doing a 
 lot 
 in bridging that gap 
 really 
 yeah i 
 definitely in line with uh what was just 
 said even in terms of language barriers 
 but i think there's so many 
 um 
 i mean i think the world is divided even 
 like by 
 by opportunities economic boundaries 
 things like that and 
 by virtue of the fact that the creator 
 of the language you know is is born in 
 one of always 
 lives in or was born in one of the 
 wealthier parts of the world 
 then what happens is you know that the 
 community around that or the center of 
 that community is kind of based in those 
 spaces and i think sometimes the 
 aftermath of that what it looks like is 
 that you know we have a very large uh 
 growing community python community on 
 the continent of africa 
 but it is very difficult for example for 
 a pipeline developer to become 
 a python developer in africa 
 to become like for example a core 
 developer because maybe 
 a lot of some of the core developers for 
 example become core developers by 
 attending the sprints right 
 but 
 people who's leading the sprint is the 
 core developers themselves and if 
 they're from 
 north america or europe then it's 
 unlikely that they'll be at a sprint in 
 africa and so because of that there's 
 like this bridge that's not there 
 where those opportunities are just not 
 there for 
 many african developers and i don't 
 think it's just those things but like 
 lots of things like theresa just 
 mentioned the language barrier can be a 
 problem 
 but i really think it's 
 i think a lot of the issues are just 
 um just not being connected as a global 
 community 
 and having those opportunities or having 
 the center of the language be in 
 regions of the world that are not 
 accessible to everyone as well so 
 thank you 
 now of course that was those were the 
 challenges we also wanted to give 
 everyone a chance to talk about a 
 success so uh the the follow-up question 
 is what what is a success you can think 
 of again you can choose the scope and um 
 yeah 
 navinito why don't you kick off 
 um 
 success in terms of like addressing this 
 challenge is 
 so 
 one thing that i've been doing is um 
 even though 
 it's a volunteering organization i've 
 been you know having meetings with these 
 people individually and trying to 
 understand what they really want to 
 achieve and if i can motivate them 
 to you know 
 contribute a little bit more 
 um 
 of also um 
 you know 
 setting those expectations 
 from them um 
 and basically 
 you know making them aware what you know 
 they could achieve 
 even you know with you know whatever 
 little they do to help us 
 down the line um the other thing is um 
 in terms of the language barrier you 
 know i have i myself have been 
 uh involved in um 
 translating a few things and wanting uh 
 i've contributed a few projects in there 
 to translate the concepts in my native 
 language 
 and someday i would like to write you 
 know translate all my blogs in my 
 language and then publish it there 
 because you know it's 
 it's pretty much kind of a remote place 
 most people understand english but then 
 there is a huge 
 urban and rural gap in india and so 
 people who are who belong to the rural 
 areas that do not have access to the 
 english materials at all they will not 
 understand it so it's one of my you know 
 ambitions sometime later but yeah thanks 
 um i could have i i could say that 
 um yeah that's it for me 
 um 
 let me break in here i'm i'm going rogue 
 i'm sorry we were going very orderly but 
 the question of translation do any of 
 the of the others of you have any 
 comments about that process it's 
 impossible it's easy what what what do 
 you think of the challenge of 
 translating 
 the documentation the community stuff 
 into 
 various other languages any any thoughts 
 on that 
 the key problem here is the 
 terminologies 
 number one number two 
 python 
 is predominantly written in english 
 so even though i translate the concepts 
 in my 
 language 
 you still need to have 
 some knowledge of english in order to 
 write code 
 so that's another thing and these are 
 the two things that comes to my mind 
 any other comments 
 can i just add on successes so this also 
 concerns with the translation and how 
 the different languages 
 uh how do we actually overcome the 
 barrier so from my region uh 
 specifically east asia southeast asia 
 none of the countries have english as 
 their main language 
 none 
 but 
 as a very as something which 
 i'm proud of 
 we've overcome that and we have run 
 the region of icon apec 
 for 
 since 2010 for every single year now 
 and all these different countries um 
 communities basically all these 
 different communities they have figured 
 out what 
 they 
 thing they need for their community and 
 they've organized around that so we've 
 basically given a free hand to each 
 other communities to decide what you 
 want to do for your particular 
 conference even though it's a regional 
 conference everyone else from 
 the rest of the countries around them 
 will come there but 
 the whole point is actually 
 uh we make 
 the regional conference for example you 
 have a euro python here in ireland so in 
 our case we have the 
 pike on apec 
 in ireland for but it is for the irish 
 so in this case for the singaporeans or 
 for the malaysians for the japanese 
 indonesians for the vietnamese 
 so we can welcome guests but we do it 
 for us 
 and 
 in that sense um 
 it's 
 an international conference so you have 
 for example three tracks and two of them 
 will be in english but there will be one 
 track in the local language 
 that's what we do and 
 what is important is that 
 uh 
 language barrier what dress i just 
 mentioned marlin just mentioned martin 
 just mentioned a very important thing 
 just now it's opportunities so language 
 barriers they take away opportunities 
 from our community people who have the 
 talent 
 and have the capabilities but do not 
 have the tools because they don't have 
 access to tools so when we have this 
 special track in 
 language or local language it opens up 
 access to role models where people can 
 come up and ask concepts in the language 
 that they are familiar with which allows 
 them to get hooked and climb into 
 our collective bus towards a particular 
 destination for the community so 
 this is one of uh i think that uh pycon 
 apec the east asia southeast region is 
 very 
 proud of one of the success i think we 
 can consider okay all right any other 
 comments on the language 
 um 
 maybe i'll go and then theresa you can 
 go after me but 
 i think it's a complicated issue because 
 like even for us to be here even for the 
 diversity and inclusion work group 
 to communicate amongst ourselves it has 
 to be a shared language right 
 so if i could not speak english you i 
 mean you wouldn't be listening to me 
 right now you wouldn't unless we had 
 like great translation and that's 
 something that python is also involved 
 in right now maybe we need more 
 real-time translation 
 um and 
 i feel like 
 you know at some point we do need some 
 shared language and i mean 
 in africa you have a lot of africans 
 being able for example to speak english 
 because we were colonized by the british 
 so 
 um i mean 
 a lot of people can speak english but i 
 think 
 so in in a way 
 english is sort of this bridge language 
 that we we have to use at the moment 
 and i think as a stepping stone to get 
 to a place where we are at least on 
 as much equal ground as we can be i 
 think english is is fine as a stepping 
 stone but i do think ideally in the 
 future as we are going on these 
 opportunities cannot stay in english 
 like iqbal says we need to 
 continue this like 
 you know movement to making sure the 
 language is translated into as many 
 you know python documentation is 
 translated into as many languages as 
 possible 
 and that becomes quite difficult because 
 i don't know necessarily if 
 like how many people are going to be 
 completely just relying on the python 
 core documentation you know 
 it's like tutorials and and things like 
 that and 
 i think that's also like a 
 community issue as well that our 
 communities smaller communities as well 
 need to be translating as well but 
 that's something we've seen quite a lot 
 of progress in recently in terms of the 
 amount of python documentation or 
 like 
 central documents um that have been 
 translated and i think even as a 
 diversity and inclusion work group we 
 had a slide 
 um 
 a python us where we showed the progress 
 in terms of 
 improvement of translation so i do think 
 it's improving 
 um i think english is a necessary evil 
 for the moment 
 so that is what i will say on that 
 probably 
 yeah theresa please 
 yeah so i think 
 um 
 coming back to what iqbal was mentioning 
 also with the tooling so the tooling 
 itself sometimes can be a barrier when 
 it's just in english uh especially as 
 it's like 
 it's the tools we use every day and i 
 remember i was at fire cascades 
 two years ago and during the springs 
 there was a track on translation 
 and that's how i found out that there's 
 quite a lot of effort and available it's 
 super easy to get into just translating 
 and providing uh 
 like translations which is like sentence 
 level for jupiter lab 
 right which is a lot of people are using 
 jupiter lab and i did it because i'm 
 from romania and i basically i just did 
 it as i had time back then to do some 
 sentences to translate in romanian so 
 that the tool is available in romanian 
 um 
 [Music] 
 on one side it's really easy once you 
 have this information to contribute 
 but basically it's not something that 
 i've 
 encountered quite often since then 
 like in your face hey look if you want 
 to contribute to translating these tools 
 improving this ecosystem making it more 
 um inclusive and accessible 
 how do you do it do it here this is this 
 information is kind of a little bit like 
 um grapevine and 
 kind of not really like you know 
 advertised a lot so i think it's also 
 something that 
 we could do because i think 
 a lot of people think that contributing 
 to open source means just writing code 
 but sometimes there's a lot of stuff 
 happening around the code that 
 would be a lot 
 easier to get into than just writing 
 perfect code to become a contributor but 
 it's just like even translating is 
 contributing 
 so i think 
 um 
 initiatives like this to be to have them 
 a little bit more like better advertised 
 is something that this is also something 
 that we could do 
 and could help quite a lot of people 
 down the line 
 okay uh thank you well okay so sorry for 
 for derailing everything let's get back 
 to to the other so theresa i think 
 you're up next in terms of a a success 
 that that you would like to call 
 attention to 
 okay yeah well that was that right i 
 think that was a success that was 
 mentioned and i think the fact that 
 [Music] 
 well 
 python documentation was translated i 
 think last year almost 100 in 
 spanish 
 and chinese was also not far away 
 but 
 yeah so i think 
 another success uh story that i like 
 whenever i think about diversity and 
 inclusion is the data umbrella 
 community 
 and i think they are doing quite a lot 
 to 
 onboard new people in contributing to 
 open source you know running sprints 
 also in africa everything is remote and 
 basically really doing a lot of effort 
 into 
 just getting people from you know 
 outside the united states contributing 
 to open source and like just getting 
 that little one step just getting the 
 foot through the door 
 so yeah 
 okay thank you um 
 marlene what's your 
 success 
 um i think 
 i've really been encouraged by seeing 
 the 
 growth in the number of people for 
 example that feel confident enough to 
 run for the psaf board of directors like 
 this year we had more people 
 running for the board 
 then like at least since i've been 
 around since than ever you've been ever 
 i'm i'm sure this is the most amount of 
 people that have run and it was it was 
 very diverse you know so many great 
 candidates 
 unfortunately all of the people that got 
 elected onto the board were from north 
 america and europe 
 though like there were so many 
 candidates from all across the world i 
 don't know what's going on there 
 but 
 it was still very encouraging to see how 
 many people felt confident enough to run 
 i am also encouraged by 
 the number of python conferences that 
 we're seeing 
 around the world you know i've been to 
 so many python conferences across africa 
 and i think that number is increasing 
 even in terms of the number of meetups 
 and things like that 
 um i mean we now have a python middle 
 east and africa as well 
 um 
 so i feel like that is very encouraging 
 i mean picon china 
 so many pythons happening across that 
 region as well so i think just seeing 
 the community continuing to grow 
 and connecting to the psf is something 
 that is very encouraging to me as well 
 okay 
 i mean you mentioned a successful 
 language do you have another one 
 um 
 i can't really point to something but 
 the fact that such a diverse region with 
 different languages 
 you don't have the same kind of people 
 even for example in indonesia for 
 example you have the sumatra islands 
 from aceh up until down to australia 
 even within indonesia itself which is 
 the biggest island nation in the world 
 has many many different types of people 
 and languages on it 
 and 
 just getting uh 
 all of us together 
 on the base of on a platform of 
 base values okay this is what we want 
 for the whole community we want them to 
 enjoy this have access to this equal 
 opportunities for that they can have the 
 tools that they need to do whatever that 
 they want and move on in their careers 
 or in the life and whatever they do 
 we've managed to run that 
 so far without much issues 
 having the conferences the meetups to be 
 accessible affordable and making it our 
 own i think alone is one of our biggest 
 success 
 yeah excellent 
 okay um we've got a couple more 
 questions here for for the group um the 
 next one is 
 what is your your suggestion maybe the 
 thing you could do if you could wave a 
 magic wand and just have something 
 happen what is your take on how to get 
 more people involved to be that um in 
 terms of voting as i think paul 
 mentioned in psf elections or in your 
 local community 
 it's kind of however you see that so um 
 let's see i think as we've rotated 
 theresa you're up 
 um 
 i would 
 um i would get more people to just join 
 as members of the psf for example um 
 just small advertisement 
 if you're contributing i think five 
 hours a month 
 to 
 python community 
 that means 
 you're running a meetup 
 everybody knows just running one meetup 
 a month takes more than five hours 
 so any of this qualifies you for 
 becoming a 
 python software foundation member 
 and then that gives you the um 
 so managing member and then then you can 
 just vote right so getting more people 
 from everywhere in the world to just 
 join and you know you get the news 
 newsletters and whatnot and then you see 
 when there's elections and you're 
 basically part of the loop and you can 
 vote next time so that that would be 
 something that i would do just get 
 everybody using python to join 
 the psf 
 members okay 
 um 
 marlene what do you think 
 um a hundred percent i think what teresa 
 said to spot on in terms of getting our 
 regional communities to vote 
 um but i also think 
 as well getting people from 
 europe or north america 
 to vote with diversity and inclusion in 
 mind like keeping in mind those 
 statistics we talked about earlier 
 hopefully that would make someone think 
 twice before putting down a name that 
 maybe you've seen around twitter or 
 something like that 
 and 
 instead maybe be a bit more thoughtful 
 in terms of how 
 for psf members how you vote so i would 
 say a combination of those two things 
 where it is within our regions trying to 
 motivate people to vote of which that is 
 like 
 a little difficult we were talking about 
 this actually quite a lot in terms of 
 how do we encourage people from our 
 regions to understand the importance of 
 voting 
 and to kind of motivate them to be able 
 to do that which i think is is actually 
 quite difficult to do 
 but those two things i think would be my 
 suggestion okay 
 all right well 
 well yeah um 
 so 
 a few things here can i just see a show 
 of hands in the audience where are you a 
 psf member in any form 
 this will be the people that who has not 
 raised their hands these are the 
 questions that we'll be asking them and 
 say they will give us the best answers 
 why are you not joining psf why are you 
 not a voting member 
 so 
 number one it is true uh 
 as part of the dni work group we have 
 started a questionnaire to actually 
 first to get to know what our community 
 members look like 
 where are you from what couple languages 
 that you speak and 
 why 
 are you aware of the psf and that you 
 can vote in the psf and 
 so far we have known from this data that 
 around 70 percent 
 are not members of the psf or they don't 
 understand that they can actually vote 
 in the ps7 what the board of directors 
 does in fact so we know this 
 and if i have a magic wand which now me 
 hopefully could give me one day 
 more than that i guess if you want let's 
 start with one 
 i'll just wave it and make everyone 
 understand okay this is a psf this is 
 for you this is the community and 
 actually it is up to us to actually take 
 action and make it shape it the way that 
 we want it to be to reflect the real us 
 the 10 million people that is using 
 python around the world today 
 so 
 uh if you will be kind enough to spend 
 just a bit five minutes get down to the 
 psf booth and then we have a 
 qr code there which you can scan and you 
 can put in your details in the 
 questionnaire tell us where you're from 
 what kind of language you speak and 
 whether you understand what the psf does 
 so that is one thing that i would like 
 the audience to do uh during the 
 conference 
 excellent 
 nobody here 
 so 
 uh i haven't been a part of the psf 
 uh you can make it for your community or 
 but yeah so that's what that's where i'm 
 going so 
 uh 
 probably there's some gap 
 um because of which i haven't known 
 before 
 the panel um 
 and now that i knew it so i wanted to 
 figure out what that is right so i went 
 i registered i raised to myself as a 
 member i'm probably the newest member 
 there and uh 
 maybe after this i i will be you know 
 more involved in there 
 right um 
 so if i had a magic wand 
 for the same reason 
 you know maybe 
 um i would want to 
 make people aware of all these different 
 initiatives that are going on to involve 
 more people 
 uh 
 you know to take part 
 yeah okay thank you okay we've got uh 
 one more question that that we have on 
 our list of things that we wanted to 
 cover which is is actually from uh iqbal 
 uh and 
 it raises the point that uh 
 python software foundation is a us-based 
 non-profit 
 and 
 you know sort of naturally then the the 
 take that they they have is the u.s 
 perspective on diversity and inclusion 
 and one thing i i have learned in in 
 traveling and in talking to people is 
 that everybody in every different place 
 has a different set of concerns and 
 solutions for diversity and inclusion so 
 our question here is particularly based 
 in in contrast this is euro python so 
 for those of you who are in europe the 
 two of you uh 
 what would you say is are some 
 differences maybe that you wished were 
 more recognized in the terms of what the 
 european reality is versus the 
 what our default tendency to 
 push the u.s perspective to the front 
 well i can i can talk from the women in 
 perspective and in ireland i 
 um 
 um i think 
 they're very less women right now 
 in in in the workspace in tech in stem 
 in general 
 um 
 and 
 i think that is 
 because 
 they don't have role models 
 from when they start schooling and by 
 the time they're in you know high school 
 they've already made a decision for 
 themselves um i think this might extend 
 to the greater 
 you know emea region 
 but by the by the by the time they're 
 already you know choosing their subjects 
 they have an opinion that you know they 
 might not want to go to stem 
 maths might be too difficult for them 
 you know um 
 assumptions like these so um 
 that's kind of a challenge well 
 and going back to maybe india 
 a lot of people are there 
 in in stem you will find like so many 
 women are there 
 but the same problem dni the diversity 
 and inclusion problem goes when you 
 climb you know higher up in your career 
 so 
 you know two very contrasting 
 um 
 subjects here one where you need 
 a lot of motivation to go 
 take the stem route 
 and i think the very few people who come 
 they they've done like excellent jobs of 
 climbing up the career whereas in you 
 know 
 india which is a developing country 
 right there are many many women who are 
 there in stem who want to pursue stem 
 their family 
 wants them to pursue stem but they only 
 go up to a certain level 
 so that's a dna challenge in two 
 different perspectives interesting 
 you can just so can you elaborate and 
 what do you mean would they go to a 
 certain level what level is that 
 yeah so they you know when they when 
 they go up in more like seniority levels 
 right so there are loads of 
 responsibilities but at the same time 
 you have changes in your personal life 
 and that's where 
 the the gap comes in 
 expectations from society 
 your general rule i mean i see okay yeah 
 right 
 okay excellent 
 teresa 
 any thoughts yeah i would say that's 
 still a problem in germany as well i 
 think 
 if you look at women in leadership the 
 percentages drop quite a lot or 
 if they are still 
 rising they are maybe for the wrong 
 reasons 
 um 
 [Music] 
 and i think 
 um i still remember when i was running 
 pie ladies meetups in hamburg in person 
 i still was getting sometimes you know 
 the 
 every now colleague asking isn't this 
 discrimination if i'm running meetups 
 just for women 
 and um 
 you know it's all this 
 i think 
 a lot of the diversity 
 conversations have just not started 
 sometimes it feels like compared to 
 united states 
 um and this is sometimes um something 
 that people working in diversity and 
 inclusion in europe they just need to be 
 prepared for all sorts of a lot of like 
 those 
 random statements questions well-meant 
 which are indian 
 in any other country would be considered 
 microaggressions but here they're like 
 well men 
 um 
 so 
 yeah i think 
 it sometimes feels like we are 
 a little bit lagging behind 
 and um it's going to take a lot of uh it 
 takes a lot more i don't know energy 
 than it should 
 and um 
 [Music] 
 so yeah 
 climbing up the career ladder is a 
 lonely planet for women in 
 in germany at least i don't know about 
 the rest of europe but i expect um at 
 some point um 
 it becomes like that and a lot of 
 companies uh if you look at even the 
 statistics on startups and um who's like 
 women founders and big companies you 
 know they are inherited and stuff like 
 that it doesn't really look good 
 um so 
 that's why i think there's a lot of 
 effort at least in europe to at least 
 get 
 more whitman through the door of um 
 yeah in the diversity and inclusion so 
 in companies in coding in stem and 
 there's a lot of 
 initiatives for 
 getting people from school already 
 because um 
 so i come from romania where you know 
 kids don't grow up being told all the 
 time that 
 you can't do this at least you can't 
 study math because you're a girl and 
 you're not going to be so good at it but 
 i've heard the stories way more often in 
 germany right and um i think 
 this is something that is currently 
 being 
 fought this one front you know to how to 
 get kids in school to go to do stem you 
 know to kind of find that you know math 
 is cool and it's not hard at all and 
 things like this so i think 
 um 
 yeah so it feels a little bit like the 
 world wants to go into one direction and 
 we have to kind of try to keep the world 
 not going in that bad direction that 
 it's trying to go to at the moment but 
 you know 
 can i just add to that sure 
 as the single 
 meal panelist 
 i just want to say that i acknowledge 
 this 
 this is a problem 
 but 
 it's 
 not a single problem for uterus or for 
 ireland sometimes it's actually a 
 worldwide problem half of our world's 
 population is women and we are not 
 using 
 the power the force 
 to we we are basically just walking on 
 one 
 feet i mean one leg when we have two 
 right um 
 unfortunately 
 i don't have the answer to this world 
 problem of hours 
 i think i would like to use the magic 
 wand from naomi to actually solve this 
 instead if i 
 can 
 japan is as not really a great example 
 of empowerment 
 of giving opportunities to women 
 the latest study says that we are 
 actually 
 one of the lowest ranking in the 
 disparity of 
 of the women not only in stem 
 but in politics in senior positions and 
 leadership roles 
 there are many reasons for this which 
 to 
 the panel will not even surface 
 right like all of you already know 
 but it is a problem and 
 we need to do whatever we can at least 
 even small steps to actually solve this 
 yeah fundamentally i mean marlin do you 
 want to go 
 what do you want to say or maybe oh you 
 can go yeah 
 fundamentally there's a problem of 
 having role models 
 i 
 in one of the recent conferences i 
 thought you know people said that 
 women seek more mentorship women seek 
 guidance more than men 
 and i think that's because 
 you know men have 
 a lot of role models out there 
 and 
 they can you know see guidance 
 mentorship pretty much available 
 but when women don't see you know 
 women or any other you know whatever you 
 identify with you know they don't see 
 somebody like them up on the stage 
 for them 
 it becomes like can i do it 
 or if they see that one person on the 
 stage 
 you know they tend to go to them and ask 
 them you know can i do it can you help 
 me get it 
 where is when you see like oh there are 
 five women on the stage 
 i could be one of them 
 this very different you know 
 psychology that goes behind it 
 yeah i think that's right um yeah i 
 think 
 absolutely that is a layer that is there 
 i i think that 
 for women definitely um 
 just just being underrepresented in 
 general in 
 um 
 in programming and computer science when 
 honestly we really shouldn't be like i 
 just don't really understand like 
 yeah it's just 
 that i think is a really big barrier in 
 terms of how we also approach 
 diversity and inclusion from that 
 inspiration perspective or you know 
 thinking i can do something i think also 
 the layer when we even drop down you 
 know one layer deeper as well i think in 
 a difference for example between 
 um 
 like what we were saying a different in 
 perspective 
 from 
 maybe the us or europe and for example 
 with africa it's just like 
 you know 
 sometimes the diversity that we have to 
 take into consideration is like economic 
 diversity and that's like probably for 
 me i would say in africa 
 probably one of the number one thing 
 that is like on my mind when i think 
 about diversity and inclusion there say 
 for example 
 right now we are going we went into 
 covid 
 and i 
 i mean here with your python and 
 pyconyues and all of these other 
 conferences 
 it was like relatively seamless to be 
 able to 
 um 
 to host a remote conference teresa is 
 calling us in from you know calling here 
 from germany but when we tried to 
 organize pycon africa remotely 
 it was very difficult it was extremely 
 difficult and you know prices of data i 
 feel like data is just very expensive 
 for and and it's not always like easy to 
 stream things live and things like that 
 and so i just think in terms of like 
 economics that's like 
 makes there be like an extra layer there 
 and so 
 we are even thinking okay someone might 
 even feel motivation feel that they can 
 do something but do they actually have 
 the resources to be able to do it and so 
 it's also thinking okay how do we make 
 things accessible how do we make 
 programming 
 accessible for people in places that 
 don't have the same 
 amount of money they can't spend 100 and 
 something dollars on a laptop or 
 something like that how do we get them 
 raspberry pi's or something that are 
 like 
 a lot more affordable to maybe get the 
 basics of that down and then how do we 
 let them get to the next step of that 
 you know so this is even before we're 
 thinking about do they have the 
 motivation but if they get the 
 motivation what do they do then you know 
 so i think those are also layers of 
 diversity and inclusion that we have to 
 keep in mind as well yeah 
 absolutely okay um 
 those those are our questions i think um 
 before we we do anything else um i'd 
 like to offer each of you kind of a 
 chance for a closing statement call to 
 action whatever you want are are you up 
 for that or not yeah okay well go ahead 
 marlene i think 
 you're you're the next in the rotation 
 okay perfect yeah i just think well 
 first of all i just want to say thank 
 you to everyone that came to this this 
 session in general um 
 just i think that people need to care 
 about diversity and inclusion i think 
 it's awesome to care about the technical 
 side of the language but just the 
 community aspect of it there's like a 
 human side to throughout this conference 
 i've been hearing people saying that 
 programmers are humans too and i think 
 there's a human side of of python and so 
 i think it's awesome that people care 
 about this issue so 
 i think if you have come to this panel 
 station if you are interested in 
 the work the diversity and inclusion 
 work group is doing or 
 whatever it is i would say number one 
 sign up to be a member of the psaf you 
 can do that at python.org 
 and when the election comes please vote 
 for someone who is not from europe or 
 north america that would be like even 
 though you're from europe please rebel 
 from your own people 
 so i would say that i would also say 
 i would encourage you to if you do get 
 the chance as well 
 to go to conferences that are outside of 
 europe and north america if you can i 
 know that can be tricky as well 
 but definitely encourage you to also 
 kind of get out of your own perspective 
 and try and travel to other spaces to be 
 able to like understand 
 some of the challenges and i think that 
 natural exchange is is actually quite 
 helpful for 
 diversity and inclusion so i think that 
 would be my call to action 
 ghana is coming up soon the cfp i think 
 might still be open so if you would like 
 to go to ghana 
 feel free to apply to that yeah 
 okay call to action 
 register as a voting member 
 vote 
 organize meetups organize conferences 
 i have found it personally very 
 rewarding and very powerful to get 
 involved with 
 people 
 which are different than me 
 where i stay the language that i usually 
 speak from 
 and backgrounds 
 whether it's cultural or social economic 
 backgrounds and they always come to a 
 point where we 
 share a common thing a common value and 
 those are usually during the conferences 
 such as this 
 i also make it a point when i go to a 
 conference to volunteer like what i'm 
 doing for europe item 2 and that 
 automatically allows me access to the 
 people there 
 and also understand them better which 
 allows me to bring back things and we 
 can learn from one another which will 
 only make us better and stronger 
 and go further together 
 and 
 go scan the barcode down at the booth 
 right 
 yes yes scan the barcode down the booth 
 and tell us who you are where you're 
 from and 
 what language you speak and whether you 
 understand what the psf does yes 
 i second that 
 and of course i'll pitch for 
 uh voting for psf i'm gonna do 
 next year yeah next year is it four 
 times 
 100 
 um 
 and then 
 just 
 on the 
 just on the side of um 
 maybe last comments 
 um 
 i started with saying like 
 for me um 
 diversity and inclusion means breaking 
 from the stereotypes 
 so um my last words would be like you 
 know 
 if you if you have a certain perspective 
 in your mind already about someone some 
 community summaries 
 the different you know categories there 
 are 
 think about that that one single person 
 that individual who that person is and 
 is it worth 
 um stereotyping that person and and 
 discriminating against that person is 
 that is it worth it why would you do it 
 you know 
 so get over the stereotypes celebrate 
 individuality 
 and that's it and vote for psf 
 excellent thank you 
 yeah theresa 
 i have on the side of organizing things 
 and events now that we're doing more and 
 more conferences and meetups and small 
 events large events i think the large 
 events are 
 starting to be better formed in a sense 
 everybody who's organizing in large 
 events now cares about diversity and 
 inclusion and to kind of have diverse 
 lineups diverse attendance 
 but we should try not to forget the 
 small event so if you're organizing a 
 meet-up 
 try to get your community involved and 
 try to get more local people also 
 engaged and to present of course it's 
 always nice to bring a celebrity in but 
 try to figure out how do you get the 
 local people 
 who are 
 representatives of your community 
 engaged and you know to to get and also 
 ask yourself what do i have to do to get 
 a 
 diverse lineup is my lineup are the 
 people attending diverse enough and what 
 am i doing wrong and reach out if you 
 don't have the answers it's really 
 important that we are having these 
 conversations 
 trying to really you know 
 care about diversity care about 
 inclusion and also all the intersections 
 of diversity right and think about all 
 the 
 yeah what can you do in your community 
 to have 
 more of that 
 because then everybody's gonna come 
 i think i hope 
 and have fun 
 with python 
 thank you thank you um i i think we're 
 really right about it at the end of time 
 so uh thanks to everyone who joined us 
 um either you know in person or remote 
 we didn't forget about you don't worry 
 uh and uh again these are good things to 
 think about and 
 these are some people that you might 
 want to talk to 
 if you want to pursue this more 
 so yeah thanks everyone 
 thank you naomi 
 bye-bye thank you nate thank you 
 thank you thank you everyone 
 so thank you for um thank you naomi for 
 moderating thank you and teresa's gone 
 off now so thank you i want to say thank 
 you marlene iqbal and nabanita we do 
 have like two minutes 
 if um if people are if you're okay for a 
 cuban quick q a 
 do we have anything remote 
 no 
 is there anyone want to uh you can 
 approach the mic if you have a question 
 just up here 
 one of two questions i think we should 
 be okay 
 hi there so first of all thank you for 
 organizing this panel and thanks to all 
 panelists it was a very interesting 
 discussion that's better 
 so i was wondering about the votes of 
 the psf did you ever consider 
 to include quotas like to make quarters 
 for 
 diversity into the vote for board of 
 directors 
 so that would be yeah i'm interested in 
 that 
 i know there's been discussion about 
 having dedicated seats for regions 
 and that has been something that has 
 been discussed but it's never actually 
 been implemented or it hasn't been 
 implemented yet you know that's 
 something i think could be a really good 
 solution but 
 it is something that would be quite a 
 big change and needs consensus both from 
 the board and then from the community so 
 if there's going to be a bylaw change 
 there has to be a quorum in terms of 
 every single like in terms of 
 a high enough number of the members 
 voting for that vital change to happen 
 so it is a that's a great question and 
 it's a great idea that i think would 
 work 
 to an extent so hopefully it does happen 
 in the future yeah good luck with that 
 thank you 
 i'm really sorry we're just like i'm 
 just got so you can um um they will be 
 down in the psw of question penis and 
 you'll find nabanita around as well so 
 i'm really sorry about that 
 um i'm also a member of psf and you need 
 to talk if i'm on the yellow shirt so 
 you definitely can find me 
 with any questions and go down to the 
 psf 
 table in the forum and it's coffee break 
 in a few minutes so it's five past so 
 thank you again to panel thank you to 
 everyone here from joining us it's been 
 quite important and i learned a lot 
 and also naomi and myself are also on 
 the psf brands work group as well 
 and so um so we need more people to give 
 more input be nice as well not just in 
 europe and north definitely i totally 
 agree thank you again i learned a lot 
 and thank you everyone 
 thank you thank you

 in my team execution research everything 
 starts from data 
 after getting the data we do our 
 research and analysis on this data to 
 test our ideas 
 and then finally we have to get it in an 
 output format such that trading or 
 trading strategies can pick this up and 
 this whole workflow almost exclusively 
 works in python 
 working in a company that has 
 aspirations to be the best at what they 
 do that's what drives people solving 
 problems and having the best people with 
 you trying to solve those problems you 
 can't beat that 
 [Music] 
 there are people who are actually able 
 to not only look at the data and 
 understand it but analyze it and express 
 it in a way that others understand 
 and that's i suppose that's the gift of 
 a great storyteller 
 [Music] 
 we're here 
 at microsoft and we have been sponsoring 
 era python for i believe four years now 
 it's been some time and we're excited to 
 be back here this year yeah so for euro 
 python this year um our team has a few 
 talks 
 lined up for some of the attendees so 
 we're doing that and we also have some 
 cool swag and stickers for all the 
 attendees as well some of them might be 
 limited edition we'll see 
 and we absolutely love europe python 
 because of the community the european 
 community is amazing and we love being 
 able to see them in hearing person get 
 this just this connection that we nor we 
 can't have virtually but it's always not 
 the same in person is always like that 
 really great conversations and we get 
 like 
 great feedback from our users as well 
 but most importantly it's the 
 conversations about how much we love 
 python all the amazing things we do 
 with this like the european 
 community 
 so we're a brand new sponsor for uh for 
 euro python this year bank of america 
 mainly here as a recruitment drive we 
 have you know plenty of open roles in 
 the python space 
 both in core app development django 
 flask and 
 uh and across full stack as well in 
 terms of doing something special for the 
 attendees we have a really interesting 
 speaker this year in terms of nile 
 o'connor talking about asset price 
 reversals um 
 without the normal swag and uh special 
 gifts for people and we'll be doing some 
 some raffles and giveaways um and if 
 there's anyone who wants to talk to us 
 at the desk we're here all through the 
 conference i guess we chose european 
 because a it's in dublin and it's the 
 first time since uh be covered times 
 we've been able to get people together 
 and really you know promote what we do 
 in bank america in terms of python um 
 you know it's a very much 
 a python focused 
 conference which is really where our 
 tech stack lies and where a lot of our 
 projects are within bank of 
 america so hi my name is marianne shine 
 and i'm the head of hr and operations 
 with umnitza in ireland 
 so this is umnitz's first year to 
 sponsor europe python we're so excited 
 to celebrate this year and participate 
 in europe python 
 coming to ireland so umnitsa is a us 
 company with our r d based in galway in 
 the west of ireland we have employees 
 all over ireland and we thought this 
 would be a great opportunity to bring 
 them along today and participate in the 
 ecosystem the python ecosystem and 
 really learn from 
 other professionals within this area 
 this year we're actually sponsoring the 
 pie ladies lunch so nitza are very 
 passionate about gender diversity within 
 our engineering team in galway we 
 currently have 33 
 females in our team and so we're very 
 privileged and honored to sponsor the 
 pie ladies lunch which i think is taking 
 place on friday so we're very excited to 
 be here i think european python is a 
 very unique conference 
 and because i think it 
 brings people who are passionate about 
 python together 
 and really gives them the opportunity to 
 learn about the most progressive 
 practices within python and also 
 leverage the wider 
 python ecosystem

 and really you know promote what we do 
 in in bank america in terms of python 
 you know it's a very much 
 a python focused 
 conference which is really where our 
 tech stack lies and where a lot of our 
 projects are within bank of america 
 so hi my name is marianne shine and i'm 
 the head of horn operations with umnitsa 
 in ireland 
 so this is umnitz's first year to 
 sponsor europe python we're so excited 
 to celebrate this year and participate 
 in euro python 
 coming to ireland so umnitsa is a u.s 
 company with our orandie based in galway 
 in the west of ireland we have employees 
 all over ireland and we thought this 
 would be a great opportunity to bring 
 them along today and participate in the 
 ecosystem the python ecosystem and 
 really learn from 
 other professionals within this area 
 this year we're actually sponsoring the 
 pi ladies lunch so nitza are very 
 passionate about gender diversity within 
 our engineering team in galway we 
 currently have 33 
 um females in our team 
 and so we're very privileged and honored 
 to sponsor the pie ladies lunch which i 
 think is taking place on friday so we're 
 very excited to be here i think european 
 python is a very unique conference 
 and because i think it 
 brings people who are passionate about 
 python together 
 and really gives them the opportunity to 
 learn about the most progressive 
 practices within python 
 and also leverage the wider

 in my team execution research everything 
 starts from data 
 after getting the data we do our 
 research and analysis on this data to 
 test our ideas 
 and then finally we have to get it in an 
 output format such that trading or 
 trading strategies can pick this up and 
 this whole workflow almost exclusively 
 works in python 
 [Music] 
 working in a company that has 
 aspirations to be the best at what they 
 do that's what drives people solving 
 problems and having the best people with 
 you trying to solve those problems you 
 can't beat that 
 there are people who are actually able 
 to not only look at the data and 
 understand it but analyze it and express 
 it in a way that others understand 
 and that's i suppose that's the gift of 
 a great storyteller 
 [Music] 
 um 
 uh we're here 
 at microsoft and we have been sponsoring 
 era python for i believe four years now 
 it's been some time and we're excited to 
 be back here this year yeah so for 
 europe python this year 
 our team has a few talks 
 lined up for some of the attendees so 
 we're doing that and we also have some 
 cool swag and stickers for all the 
 attendees as well some of them might be 
 limited edition we'll see 
 and we absolutely love your python 
 because of the community the european 
 community is amazing and we love being 
 able to see them in here in person get 
 this just this connection that we nor we 
 can't have virtually but it's always not 
 the same in person is always like that 
 really great conversations and we get 
 like 
 great feedback from our users as well 
 but most importantly it's the 
 conversations about how much we love 
 python all the amazing things we do 
 with this like the european 
 community 
 so we're a brand new sponsor for uh for 
 european this year bank of america 
 mainly here as a recruitment drive we 
 have you know plenty of open roles in 
 the python space 
 both in core app development django 
 flask and 
 uh and across full stack as well 
 in terms of doing something special for 
 the attendees we have a really 
 interesting speaker this year in terms 
 of nine o'clock talking about asset 
 price reversals um 
 without the normal swag and uh special 
 gifts for people and we'll be doing some 
 some raffles and giveaways um and if 
 there's anyone who wants to talk to us 
 at the at the desk we're here all 
 through the conference guess we chose 
 europe because a it's in dublin and it's 
 the first time since peak overtimes i've 
 been able to get people together and 
 really you know promote what we do in

 good afternoon everybody welcome back 
 from the coffee break 
 um so in a minute we'll get started with 
 uh jaiway wang's presentation on scalpel 
 chairway is visiting us all the way from 
 melbourne um for your python conference 
 and i hope you'll join me in giving him 
 a warm welcome and an applause 
 [Applause] 
 thank you very much 
 it's really my great honor to be here to 
 speak uh 
 at the conference 
 so the one the topic i'm going to 
 present today is called the static of 
 analysis of framework so before i'm 
 going to start 
 can someone tell me 
 how much do you know anything about 
 static analysis 
 if you if you can hand up 
 so many okay thank you 
 um also i would like to mention 
 that uh actually there are two speakers 
 for this project but uh he just 
 couldn't make this trip before family 
 issue so i will finish this talk alone 
 so first of all something about uh about 
 our team i'm from i'm a final year phd 
 student at monash university i'm a 
 member of smart lab 
 in the department of software systems 
 and cyber security so in our lab 
 basically it's called a smart anal smart 
 software analysis and trustworthy 
 computing so we work on the research on 
 software engineering and program 
 analysis in particular my own research 
 interest is static program analysis for 
 python code so we are from national 
 youth university and located in 
 melbourne australia we are the group of 
 eight universities in australia normally 
 it's considered the first 
 one of the best universities in 
 australia 
 now let's talk about the something about 
 software engineering research because i 
 know quite a few of you are actually 
 from industry software engineering 
 research is kind of it's very broad 
 concept 
 it's try to analyze the different 
 aspects of software applications of 
 their production software development 
 and developers 
 so our purpose 
 are we try to identify the code defects 
 for instance for a large amount a very 
 large code base we hope to identify 
 where the 
 where bugs are and are located and if 
 there are memory leaks as well and also 
 there are vulnerable if there are 
 security vulnerabilities so these are 
 really very 
 costly for industry sometimes if they do 
 it manually and the second 
 topic about the software engineering 
 research is we try to build software 
 development techniques such as ide 
 supports for instance 
 code completion or api recommendations 
 so we provide 
 more and more tools or techniques for 
 developers to radically more efficiently 
 and we also in the broad context of 
 software engineering we also have 
 empirical funding studies such as 
 so-called empirical software engineering 
 it's a study on the evolution patterns 
 or human aspects of 
 software and software production because 
 a major component of software production 
 is human so human human issues in 
 software engineering research are very 
 very important in today's talk i'm going 
 to 
 give 
 give the introduction about our work 
 it's about statical program analysis so 
 many of you although so many of you have 
 the knowledge of a static analysis but i 
 still want to give the introduction 
 we study the behaviors of computer 
 programs 
 and by scanning source code only we can 
 discover the code defects during their 
 development phase so that people can fix 
 it automatically or manually so static 
 analysis is normally required to be 
 scalable to very large amount of source 
 source code and our product is purely 
 100 static approach and the reason we 
 use static approach is simply because 
 for many scenarios we cannot actually 
 execute the program or we can not 
 actually generate all the possible 
 inputs for your program let's see you 
 have a source code 
 a product maybe it's a meaningless of 
 code and how can you use human labor to 
 identify the box and how can we actually 
 actually this program a program can take 
 maybe a week or two weeks to finish 
 execution and if you wanted to test 
 to test a software system in trying to 
 fit in all the possible inputs that's 
 unrealistic so this is the static 
 program analysis so here's an import 
 here's an example called that we have a 
 case variable and it takes value from 
 input if the case is one then we 
 initialize a variable named a and if the 
 case is two then we initial initialize a 
 variable b so finally we add one we add 
 one to the variable a and assign it to c 
 if you remember the conditional 
 statement here and if the case is two 
 do we have the problems here 
 right so it's apparently it's because it 
 is not defined so it's this is a name 
 arrow and name arrow is the example i'm 
 going to use for this talk 
 now here's the central topic of today's 
 presentation if we look at the past 20 
 years and let's see let's look at how 
 the pattern language is being used by 
 the we simply look at the programming 
 community index for the 20 years 
 that python after the 2020 has overtaken 
 java and c as the major and the most 
 popular programming languages 
 most popular popular programming 
 language 
 today right after 2016 as you can see 
 from the diagram that clearly it grows 
 very fast 
 so 
 so the the question now is 
 be the most popular programming language 
 how do we analyze the python programs 
 and how do we build better tools because 
 it grows so fast there is a lag between 
 the 
 analysis work and the software 
 development so we let's look at the 
 first industry solutions we talk about 
 analysis so 
 we can summarize that all the major 
 techns offer the static analysis tools 
 for instance the pi tap 
 and pair write pyre by microsoft google 
 and facebook or meta so these solutions 
 are basically about about a specific 
 problem let's let's say that three of 
 the three tools i've listed here about 
 the tap checking and typing firms so 
 this is not applicable for a broader 
 challenges such as dependence analysis 
 analysis i guess many python developers 
 are really frustrated if they 
 see some dependency usually you get 
 everything done but when you download 
 the software and you try to execute it 
 and gives you more modular phone narrow 
 right so 
 so this is uh the problem with the 
 industry solutions that their approach 
 uh 
 basically about the problem a specific 
 problem so we want to also look at what 
 researchers are saying for the past 
 three years if we look at the major and 
 prestigious software engineering 
 conference 
 conferences people actually make quite a 
 few complaints about python's static 
 analysis 
 in the exe 2019's 
 nominee is considered 
 the most influential software 
 engineering conference 
 the 
 the researchers complain there are 
 limits to the tap influence so that it 
 cannot infer the dependencies for code 
 snippets and this is actually very 
 useful because in many cases we 
 get the software from the open source 
 project we actually want to reuse it if 
 we cannot 
 get the dependencies for the code we 
 already obtained from open source 
 project that would be that would be 
 meaningless for us so right after that 
 there is a research from myself 
 it's also 
 we 
 in our study we showed that there is 
 really a need for helping patent 
 developers to avoid the usage of 
 different apis because if you use 
 duplicate apis maybe 
 one year or two year or even half a half 
 year after that the apis are removed 
 from the latest packages so 
 this really costs a lot of trouble for 
 your maintenance work and right after 
 that we see a very interesting and very 
 promising work about core graph 
 generation this is about to understand 
 how function calls are represented in 
 this pattern source code but author also 
 complained that in their work that we 
 they have to 
 ignore the conditional loops but this is 
 very commonly 
 used for patent syntax features so 
 lastly this year we see a very very 
 strong comments that python cannot take 
 advantage of analysis and algorithms 
 that have been developed throughout 
 decades of research so this is a 
 personal i think this is a strong 
 comments 
 and now if we compare the python and 
 other two major programming languages 
 java and c and these two languages are 
 the major uh uh normally used for 
 software productivity especially for 
 very big tech genes like oracle and 
 google so they are really highly relied 
 on these two languages but 
 if we compare their their analysis 
 algorithms for java and c we see we can 
 clearly see that the three address code 
 ir immediate representation it's a data 
 structure 
 extracted from source code so that we 
 can build upon uh for better for other 
 tasks so it's not available for pattern 
 language and even we see the core graph 
 as i mentioned choreography is a very 
 important concept in the 
 in software analysis it's the core graph 
 construction is open problem until 2021 
 and lastly i would say that so far we 
 haven't seen a static framework such as 
 java suit 
 and this is a very very famous project 
 so two trends are so mature and 
 sophisticated in java and c languages 
 but why is this so hard for python 
 now we have to 
 look at 
 why it is so because the language are so 
 different first of all it has a dynastic 
 the scopes massive scope means you can 
 define a function inside a function 
 inside a function and in this way so 
 when i scan open source project i even 
 found a project that actually have the 
 next depth of seven times so that means 
 they have function inside a function 
 inside a function for seven times 
 i really wonder how can i develop 
 manager how can he memorize the 
 structure so the second one is higher 
 order functions this is all not a 
 feature for other two major languages 
 hair or the function means you can you 
 can use a function as a variable for 
 instance you can define a function and 
 you can pass it to 
 another name so that you can use that 
 function this is very practical and very 
 convenient for scientific computing 
 because i myself i work on scientific 
 computing very very convenient but 
 but what makes it so convenient for 
 faster prototyping makes it so difficult 
 for analysis 
 let's look at this code snippet you have 
 to define two area functions to compute 
 the error of different shapes but when 
 actually a function 
 happens how can we know that which 
 function is actually invoked right so 
 the last the second feature is dynamic 
 type of variables the variable has no 
 tab or in particular strictly speaking 
 that a variable has no type only the 
 value can be typed in pattern language 
 and 
 names variables are actually names so 
 dynamic type means the developer have to 
 have to write many different cases so 
 that 
 we can we can verify if the if the input 
 are uh belongs to a certain type and 
 pattern so called the typing right so 
 variable tabs can be can change so this 
 feature is also not part of c and java 
 which are strongly which are static 
 detector languages and lastly involving 
 syntax 
 yesterday right here i listened to a 
 very interesting question for the python 
 core developers is the involving syntax 
 for python is in the right direction of 
 python ecosystem so the question is very 
 i think it's very good for the patent 
 core developers and that the core team 
 says we believe so we believe it is in 
 the right direction 
 but i wouldn't agree in terms of static 
 analysis because fragmentation issues 
 are really a nightmare for for us so 
 involving syntax you see the pattern has 
 released releases every year so it's 
 just like a smart phone apps rather than 
 a program languages right so 
 what makes conventional analysis 
 applicable is python is so 
 unique and different from other two 
 languages so here's a good snippet that 
 given a function get array function we 
 have defined trends for different shapes 
 when the function call actually happens 
 how can you identify which function is 
 invoked so if you are interested you can 
 think about this one but 
 what makes it so hard to analyze also uh 
 is the situation when i started my phd 
 study in 2020 at that time i was just a 
 first year i realized that when i 
 developed approaches for solving some 
 challenges like dependency analysis i 
 had to build everything from scratch so 
 why not i make it an open source project 
 that was my idea so the idea was to 
 offer as many possible functionalities 
 as possible for 
 developers so we have 
 the core level that we hope to offer the 
 very critical algorithms for static 
 analysis after that we can build upon 
 some modules like api 
 name qualifications so that these 
 approaches are very practical 
 to solve some particular problem like 
 api studies we want to know that what 
 aps the python program has accessed so 
 with this one and you can solve the 
 dependency issues like if you actually 
 have 
 if you have the knowledge about what eps 
 of python program have accessed then it 
 is easier for you to know that which 
 depends which dependent libraries you 
 are going to uh to detect so this is the 
 overview of our framework 
 the objective as i said is we hope to 
 offer a set of functionalities such as 
 control flow graphs and define use 
 relation scope analysis code rewriting 
 to facilitate the program analysis for 
 patterns for the next i will explain the 
 name error as an example and i will 
 describe how we can use why the four 
 four modules i'm listing today are 
 important so now if if we take the 
 previous example uh again that we have a 
 function named toy and if case is one 
 that is zero if case is two b is zero c 
 is equal to a plus one after the if 
 statement and return a so now we know 
 the problem occurs in the uh assignment 
 for the variable c right so a comp story 
 is so you develop a you develop an 
 application and so you feel like there 
 are two 
 two packages are really useful for your 
 product i think the python developers 
 always love this uh 
 this product at this dependent libraries 
 and now we feel like we actually depend 
 on the sim library but just different 
 version constraints unfortunately but 
 even so you you have to resolve the 
 dependency but 
 this is the story like finally you give 
 you see the name error problem so the 
 name error itself 
 is 
 not so toy 
 why because we observe this frequently 
 occurred in the very popular python 
 pattern libraries such as tqdm as i 
 showed here 
 tico dam is very popular among the deep 
 learning developers is 
 is going to show a progress bar for your 
 pro for you for your program and 
 but library itself it has more than 100 
 contributors and used by more than 270 
 thousand products and that means this 
 bug actually propagates from the open 
 source project to your client program so 
 we can summarize the programs gathered 
 among patent os products but even so 
 i guess some of you may be if you work 
 on data sound you often use the 
 computational notebooks jupiter lab 
 right i heard some people are using that 
 uh other people using driven notebook 
 okay thank you so we read three years 
 ago that there's a study pointed out 
 among one million computational 
 notebooks name error is actually a major 
 problem and this this study also 
 confirmed by another 
 research by computer science research 
 computer science education research name 
 error is also a primary problem for 
 python beginners especially for students 
 i guess 
 uh although it's so simple that variable 
 is not defined this is actually not a 
 problem in c and java because compiler 
 will do that but python code just 
 execute and even it happens you don't 
 know where 
 the problem triggers now 
 if 
 if we if we see that uh it 
 if we see the code snippet in a graphic 
 way we build a control flow graph the 
 control flow graph the graph actually 
 represents all the possible execution 
 of execution paths for the given program 
 we are able to know that there is a 
 certain path that if you if the program 
 control flow goes along the path the 
 problem will occur so right here it goes 
 to from if and then 
 if kiss is true then if case is not true 
 then we see the numeral occurs so 
 building the graph will be very 
 essential for detecting such diff such 
 problem 
 but 
 only by at least by doing control flow 
 graph is not as sufficient because in 
 real-world scenario a control flow graph 
 will have more than one thousand nodes 
 even even even much uh much more so 
 this is not a possible way for us so we 
 have to do different use relations 
 offered by scapa as well so it try to 
 answer the question where does a 
 variable depend so we have a lot a set 
 of techniques such as 
 starting single seminal constant 
 propagation which i'm not going to 
 discuss too much today but we can say 
 that the relationship between all the 
 variables and their definitions will be 
 very critical for detecting software 
 bugs especially from name error because 
 apparently if you cannot find the 
 definition for a certain variable that's 
 name error right so 
 the next one is 
 sometimes we don't often just want to 
 know where the problem is we want to 
 know that we're the uh where is the code 
 of line that actually triggers the 
 problem because i've already shown you 
 that the problem occurs in the if 
 statement 
 but in in a very large scale project we 
 also want to know that where is the 
 function called right so 
 uh the the reason we want to know that 
 is this can be very essential for the 
 ide supporter 
 now to 
 to understand this information we have 
 to go to scope analysis python language 
 has so-called legb rule local enclosing 
 global building as i said pattern 
 language has a very special scope design 
 the gymnastic structure so we borrowed 
 the concept from latest research from 
 the program language theory community so 
 we built 
 something called scope graph and basic 
 based on script graph it works like this 
 first we look at the toy and we found 
 it's a local scope so we identified 
 there is no 
 the name itself is not produced or is 
 not declared in this scope now we go to 
 the enclosing one and it's not declared 
 there so we go to global one so finally 
 we found it but things are not always 
 were not always working in uh the one 
 that i'm discuss i'm speaking so we in 
 the internal representation of scalpel 
 framework we have the so-called 
 scope graph so in a scope graph we 
 represent lexical scopes in a graphic 
 way that you can see the different 
 relations here 
 let's say the case is declared in the 
 scope of function and torah is 
 referenced in the scope function and the 
 scope of a class 
 has the parallel relation of 
 scope function a modular function is the 
 root root scope here 
 so finally we can map the location of 
 the toy the name itself to its 
 definition 
 and lastly we don't we we not only want 
 to detect where the problems are we want 
 to program repair red we don't want 
 always fixed box by ourselves so 
 automation will always be the best way 
 so skype framework also offers a set of 
 apis so you so for you so that you can 
 rewrite your programs not just for 
 automatic program repair but also for 
 program transformation there will be 
 another 
 another interesting applications so the 
 transformation in a scalable remote will 
 be directly made to the abstract syntax 
 trees so the purpose is fix some errors 
 automatically so lastly i would like to 
 show you 
 that 
 we 
 a summary of our product our project has 
 more than 11 000 lines of code already 
 and this is 
 some statistical results i'm very 
 surprised i think after making is 
 after making it publicly available for 
 the community half a year just half a 
 year we have received more than 100 
 stars maybe for data scientists or maybe 
 for a very popular topics 
 this will be very easy to achieve but 
 for static analysis we don't often see 
 there are so many people who are 
 interested in such projects so i'm 
 really actually surprised so i really 
 appreciated the recognition recognition 
 from the community and lastly it's it's 
 also where i came here from australian 
 we hope to listen your opinions on our 
 project so do you have ideas for the 
 such a static analysis work if you have 
 from technical background do you have 
 a analysis algorithm that you feel like 
 that'll be better for our project now 
 i'll be really glad to talk with you or 
 you hope to work on oh you hope to 
 contribute to this project even about 
 the code review because we are from 
 academy we are not really good at 
 managing open source project 
 so 
 any 
 voice or any feedback from you will be 
 really 
 appreciated by our team so 
 lastly i would like to 
 thank all of you thank you for your time 
 early and hope you enjoy the talk i'd 
 like to take your questions next 
 okay guys let's give a warm round of 
 applause for joey 
 thank you very much for that 
 presentation i think it's really 
 interesting to see that tension between 
 uh the work we're seeing in the c python 
 runtime with all of its 
 new features and expansions uh together 
 with the desire to build static analysis 
 and improve code in that way i see we 
 have uh one question member from the 
 audience 
 yeah i have a couple questions uh so my 
 first question is about the 
 you said there are like four python 
 static analysis tools so which tools did 
 you count 
 okay uh problem is that this part it's 
 actually uh from wikipedia because it is 
 really difficult to give 
 to give the total number from no matter 
 from where so i simply use 
 the data from wikipedia i think that's a 
 standard 
 yeah because i know there's like bandit 
 uh yes which is open source there is 
 code ql which is from github and closers 
 like sonar or check marks which are 
 apparently proprietary as well yeah 
 but in that case if we count all the 
 number of products from the community we 
 have to counter for other two major 
 languages as well so as uh to be fair 
 that makes sense um 
 yeah do you actually have some rules 
 implemented there that could be used 
 like in a ci cd pipeline or maybe for 
 some security testing or things like 
 that 
 at the moment um we don't have for 
 security 
 uh 
 for security rules at the moment 
 and uh regarding scope analysis do you 
 also support those keywords like global 
 variable or non-local variable do you 
 consider this yes the statement we will 
 consider okay yeah so yeah that's all 
 questions i have had thank you thank you 
 very much 
 are there any ques 
 are there any other questions at this 
 point if so please approach the 
 microphone here 
 hello 
 thank you for you for your presentation 
 so i would like to ask you also if you 
 did some performance evaluation of your 
 algorithm for the call graph 
 construction or the main evaluation 
 the performance so if you do the time 
 performance 
 the performance yes 
 in terms of internal execution 
 efficiency is like for 
 control for the name error detection 
 itself because knee barrel is right now 
 detection is a part of my research we 
 have to release that data to the free 
 open source project because for some 
 academic purpose 
 at the moment i mean but we are going to 
 but i can see that for average open 
 source projects we scan it uh like 
 zero point seventeen nine uh zero point 
 and seven seventy seconds per source 
 file so i think it's a reasonable 
 okay yes thank you thank you 
 yeah but i think this is a really 
 important question because statin 
 analysis must be scalable otherwise it 
 doesn't make any sense 
 yeah thank you 
 are there any other questions at this 
 point for joy 
 if not then we'll round off uh this 
 session with another round of applause 
 and a thank you for joy 
 [Applause] 
 and then it'll be a few minutes uh 
 before the next session starts which is 
 at 405 so i hope to see you then uh here 
 in the auditorium thank you 
 umnitza is the enterprise technology 
 management solution that consolidates 
 data from existing silo tools to provide 
 a single source of truth for endpoints 
 applications 
 a good afternoon to you all and welcome 
 to 
 our afternoon session at 405 
 we're starting in a minute 
 for a session that i'm personally 
 looking forward to 
 because i'm a very lazy person 
 and i hate cleaning up and so the 
 promise of automatically cleaning up my 
 code is enticing to me 
 next to me is esther 
 organizer of 
 python italy if i'm saying that 
 correctly 
 and i hope you'll join me in giving her 
 a warm round of applause and wish you 
 good luck with her talk 
 thank you 
 thank you 
 so 
 okay 
 i'm esther i work for made.com a uk 
 company 
 that design and sell home furniture 
 online 
 and in other part of europe as well 
 and i also pick an italian organizer and 
 developer 
 i recently joined to strawberry graphql 
 as a core dev 
 and 
 also as a poetry packer manager 
 contributor 
 so with this organization 
 i have seen a lot of tools and 
 automation that i think they are really 
 great and help 
 to have a better developer experience so 
 today i would like to show them to you 
 and oh we are sale by the way 
 and so you can go on made a comment 
 check if you like something and i should 
 also mention that 
 my team has recently 
 fixed a little thing that 
 uh about 
 ireland postcode validation so now we 
 can ship also to ireland 
 and other countries so go check online 
 please 
 so 
 have you ever been in this situation 
 when 
 so you're working on a feature you are 
 writing some code and 
 i think you're really i you finish your 
 work the tests are passing locally 
 so 
 you are 
 ready to commit your court and push your 
 code 
 and at this point i think we have some 
 time to kill because the pipeline can 
 took a while 
 so we can 
 go out for a walk relaxing get 
 distracted 
 at some point we will remember that we 
 have to work and we will go back 
 on the pipeline and see that everything 
 is 
 is red 
 we forgot to run the linters locally so 
 the pipeline 
 warns us that the good quality is not 
 richard 
 and it's facilitying and we should have 
 learned our lesson and next time we will 
 remember to run the linters but the 
 truth is that we will probably forgot 
 anyway at some point 
 also because 
 sometimes you do a silly change that 
 doesn't 
 shouldn't change so much but that's 
 silly change that that breaks black or 
 icert 
 so 
 we probably 
 was a bit of time because the pipeline 
 took a while because we never optimized 
 docker 
 so on anyway 
 we can optimize a bit the stuff and 
 introduce our first tool 
 that is become it become it is a 
 multi-language package manager for 
 procomic hooks and it will run 
 automatically on every comment before 
 every comment 
 so we have just to create a little bit 
 of configuration and there is a nice 
 command 
 sample config that we create for you and 
 we have to run recommit install 
 so 
 this is 
 our configuration file 
 and you can see 
 there is repo there is the version 
 because precomitt will install 
 the stuff in a separate environment and 
 everyone in your team will help will 
 have the same version 
 and yeah and there there are the id of 
 the hooks 
 so there are 
 many things you can add to your 
 programming configuration and i think in 
 a python weapon you should always add at 
 least black eye sort 
 and flick 8 or violin 
 but there are many and the list is very 
 long and you can check online 
 those are some of my favorite so there 
 is fire grade that automatically upgrade 
 the syntax to a newer version of python 
 so our code is up to date and hopefully 
 it will be a bitter 
 faster 
 and there is a flake eradicator so 
 that will notify us that we'll have some 
 commented code 
 and the last one is a nice one 
 because 
 flicate or pyland 
 only tell you that you there is a 
 missing 
 there is an unused importer and use 
 variables but they didn't they didn't 
 remove it for you instead out of lake we 
 removed it automatically 
 so what else we can add the list is long 
 but it's not always about good quality 
 it's also for our safety 
 because there are some dangerous stuff 
 some secret oops i'm sorry 
 yeah this is the correct one 
 so 
 it's also for our safety because 
 we are very careful to not commit some 
 secrets and dangerous stuff by the truth 
 is that when it's committed it's kind of 
 too late 
 because you will leave it there 
 kind of forever in your just history 
 somewhere 
 so this is just an example what type of 
 stuff you can add to your checks 
 why 
 we should 
 add 
 pre-commit so i trying to to answer this 
 question 
 and 
 one of the 
 benefit is because it will help to 
 identify the silly issues 
 like 
 leaving some debug statement in the code 
 or missing a new line at the end of the 
 code 
 also because 
 this stuff 
 always only appears during the code 
 review because github did a very good 
 job to emphasize that you're missing a 
 new line at the end of the code with 
 this tiny icon 
 and so in my organization there are i 
 think 
 a lot of these comments 
 and if you use sparcometer 
 they will you will remove earlier so 
 we can concentrate only on what matters 
 so the core review the code water is 
 really change 
 also to me is a bit 
 awkward sometimes when i say this 
 a little mistake 
 because i wonder myself should i bother 
 to notify the author 
 or i should look in an in another way 
 because 
 the work will 
 the code will work anyway 
 so 
 maybe i already comment a lot of stuff 
 in the pull request this big 
 and yeah so 
 we can avoid this stuff 
 also is because 
 our day nowadays 
 we have a lot of code it is not only 
 python we have 
 no matter if you have a monorepo or 
 microservices we have python we have 
 terraform infrastructure or ansible some 
 bash 
 scripts so markdown because we have a 
 documentation 
 json file for for fixer anything so 
 it's multi-language so you can add a 
 hook for to format any code that is 
 going to be read 
 and 
 yeah so i tried to ask myself why people 
 don't like it because of course i'm a 
 bit biased because i love this tool so 
 it's difficult for me to identify 
 why 
 and i wrote to it and maybe my bubble 
 already use it anyway i think 
 one of the 
 main reason is because people think it 
 is slow but i don't think it's the case 
 because of course the first time you add 
 the precomi to your 
 repo 
 and you promote all your code base of 
 course that can take a while 
 but 
 normally it will take only a few seconds 
 especially because 
 it's incremental so you 
 recommend we run only on the code 
 that you are about to commit 
 and also because for example if you 
 commit some terraform code it will run 
 only the hook for terraform not for 
 python so this is very quick 
 anyway can be that some 
 hooks are slower than others for example 
 pylint 
 my pie 
 that 
 hoax that has to analyze the code can be 
 slower of course 
 and you can skip it or you can run one 
 at a time 
 you can skip there entirely 
 and it's okay anyway for example if 
 you're doing pair programming and you 
 commit frequently you don't want to 
 bother to the cut quality so it's okay 
 you can run later if you want 
 and 
 yeah so there are options to 
 mitigate if there is this problem 
 also i should mention that they add a 
 manual stage 
 so by default we're coming will run on 
 every stage there is not only comet 
 there is pre-commit 
 push 
 past 
 commit pre-merge post merge there are a 
 lot of them 
 and they're introducing one of stage so 
 if you have something that you have to 
 run only once in a while you can run it 
 manually 
 and this 
 this is a nice feature 
 and 
 yeah the only thing now that we have to 
 remember is to run prekum install when 
 you clone the repo 
 the only thing 
 we can potentially avoid if we do a nice 
 trick 
 so if you add 
 a d template in your home 
 directory in your jit home default 
 directory so edit template is 
 so when you clone or initialize a repo 
 there are some files that will be copied 
 from this default directory of jit into 
 your dot jit directory 
 so you can add a little script in your 
 default directory and will be copied and 
 it will still pre-commit for you so 
 after you don't have to remember 
 anything and 
 if the rapper you clone doesn't have 
 percommit and doesn't use percommit you 
 will just print 
 something and leave it there 
 so 
 cool 
 so i think one specification is needed 
 because 
 using precomit or non-using precomite is 
 your a personal choice so you should not 
 force your 
 team to use it if they don't want it and 
 i think at the end of the day whatever 
 makes you productive uh it's okay so 
 choose what you do every commeet every 
 push there are many options whatever fit 
 to for you it's okay 
 so 
 whatever it what else we can do we can 
 run of course on our pipeline 
 uh 
 because we want to check 
 double check the code quality of course 
 and there is also precomit ci 
 and and it's it's nice because brecomici 
 can also edit the code for you so you 
 can also fix 
 the hooks 
 so check it out 
 and i think for public repo is is free 
 what else 
 so if you like me new organization have 
 a make file in your project 
 so 
 every team can decide what to put inside 
 they make files so we'd ended up with a 
 bunch of commands 
 that they do 
 always 
 basically the same thing anyway 
 so at this point if you have pre-commit 
 i don't think we use them anymore so we 
 can clean up our long may file 
 and 
 yeah 
 clean it up 
 so we have one tool to run the all 
 and 
 that means that we have a lot of hooks 
 now 
 so every hooks need a little bit of 
 configuration 
 and this configuration is stored in a 
 file and usually in your root directory 
 so that means we have a bunch of dot 
 file dot csv in your root 
 so we can think about cleaning up also 
 the repo and your root and move it in a 
 special file kyle called 
 by project dot tom 
 so what is my project tom 
 so 
 at the beginning of python there was 
 only one tool to build packages 
 but after some point 
 setup tools came out and create some 
 issues so 
 this pep 
 518 
 managed to solve these issues and 
 after every project can specify which 
 build system they want to use 
 there are many 
 um 
 but what's the matter for us 
 it's because 
 there there is also special session for 
 tools 
 so we can add there 
 uh the 
 configurations 
 not every tool allowed 
 you to use by project many of them are 
 already 
 integrated this functionality 
 other one are 
 developing 
 or migrating to this but you should 
 check their documentation if they 
 support or not 
 i talk about specifically about pi 
 project.tom 
 because i want to introduce another 
 build system they think it's amazing and 
 it's called 
 poetry packer manager 
 and is a all-in-one tool to manage 
 dependency virtual environment packaging 
 versions 
 um some languages like go or rust 
 has a tool that manages all the aspect 
 of your project but python doesn't have 
 a tool like this 
 built-in 
 poetry managed to compensate this 
 and what does it mean for you it means 
 that you can delete the setup ui that is 
 deprecated by the way requirements set 
 up cfg and others other 
 file that you have 
 and have only one by project.file so how 
 it look look like this hope you see it 
 so 
 you can see at the beginning there is 
 some information about a metadata 
 and the description the versioning we 
 have the dependency the specification of 
 the dependency and they are grouped by 
 the production dependency above and 
 below the dive dependency 
 these are only the primary dependencies 
 so those you add to your project 
 because when you install when you do 
 poetry.install 
 it will create another file called 
 poetry.lock in there you have this exact 
 specific version of your dependency so 
 in your team when someone install 
 the project it will will have the same 
 versions 
 that you have 
 so this 
 is easy to debug the stuff 
 okay i should mention that 
 uh poetry 
 1.2 is coming very soon hopefully 
 and in we'll introduce some nice feature 
 like group dependency so until now you 
 have only the production 
 data dependency and extra dependency 
 after that you can 
 decide how to name your group how to 
 group and name 
 your dependency so you can create the 
 task dependency the 
 docs dependency deploy dependency 
 whatever 
 it also has a plugin system so it means 
 you can customize this tool on your 
 needs so it's very interesting i'm very 
 looking forward to this 
 and 
 yeah this is how it's look like 
 sport install 
 is very fast because it's paralyzed 
 and there are many commands 
 so poetry add with our dependency 
 voice update poetry run 
 your for example if you do a poetry run 
 python your script will run the script 
 in your invite environment without the 
 need to activate your environment and 
 this is kind of cool 
 because you don't have to activate and 
 wait 
 can can be slow my i'm very slow when i 
 have to activate the environment so this 
 is really great 
 and of course you can 
 publish the package if you have a 
 library on pipeline just with a simple 
 command 
 so 
 yeah 
 uh 
 the very last thing i have to say is 
 that 
 uh jettabrains 
 has done a survey recently hope you can 
 see it is wide enough 
 but 
 yeah there are many questions in it 
 regarding 
 the development and 
 it's very interesting here i was very 
 surprised to see how much people are 
 using poetry already 
 for dependency for packaging for 
 a lot of stuff for vital environment so 
 it's 
 it kind i think the third 
 tools 
 depends on on the need and depends on 
 what you 
 are looking for but yeah it's pretty 
 great i think 
 okay 
 i don't know 
 what's happening 
 now i finish 
 my talk i don't know why it's not oh 
 okay 
 okay leave it there thank you so much 
 for your attention 
 so thank you very much for the 
 presentation esther 
 one thing i definitely picked up is to 
 put in a hook to prevent my private keys 
 from pushing to repos because that 
 certainly wasn't a fun working day 
 and i'd like to prevent that in the 
 future 
 are there any questions at this point 
 for esther if so please approach the 
 mike here at the center stage 
 i'll also look 
 nope no remote questions yet 
 okay 
 if there are no questions at this point 
 i will thank you very much once more and 
 we'll round off 
 next thing here is the lightning talks 
 at a quarter to five i'd love to see 
 there 
 after getting the data we do our 
 research and analysis on this data to 
 test our ideas 
 and then finally we have to get it in an 
 output format such that trading or 
 trading strategies can pick this up and 
 this whole workflow almost exclusively 
 works in python 
 i can use this one working in a company 
 that has aspirations to be the best at 
 what they do that's what drives people 
 solving problems and having the best 
 people 
 sorry 
 for people with the tickets for the 
 social event 
 if you don't have your ticket please go 
 to the registration to collect it we 
 still have like 60 that are waiting 
 there 
 and you need that to go in 
 if you're organizer also you have to go 
 there thank you 
 [Music] 
 so uh we're here 
 at microsoft and we have been sponsoring 
 era python for i believe four years now 
 it's been some time and we're excited to 
 be back here this year yeah so for euro 
 python this year 
 our team has a few talks uh lined up for 
 some of the attendees so we're doing 
 that and we also have some cool swag and 
 stickers for all the attendees as well 
 some of them might be limited edition 
 we'll see 
 and we absolutely love your python 
 because of the community 
 the european community is amazing and we 
 love being able to see them in hearing 
 person get this just this connection 
 that we nor we can't have virtually but 
 it's always not the same in person is 
 always like that 
 really great conversations and we get 
 like um 
 great feedback from our users as well 
 but most importantly it's the 
 conversations about how much we love 
 python all the amazing things we do 
 with this like the european 
 community 
 so we're a brand new sponsor for uh for 
 euro python this year bank of america 
 mainly here as a recruitment drive we 
 have you know plenty of open roles in 
 the python space 
 both in core app development django 
 flask and 
 across full stack as well 
 in terms of doing something special for 
 the attendees we have a really 
 interesting speaker this year in terms 
 of nile o'connor talking about asset 
 price reversals 
 without the normal swag and uh special 
 gifts for people and we'll be doing some 
 some raffles and giveaways um and if 
 there's anyone who wants to talk to us 
 at the desk we're here all through the 
 conference guess we chose european 
 because a it's in dublin and it's the 
 first time since uh overtimes i've been 
 able to get people together and really 
 you know promote what we do in bank 
 america in terms of python um 
 you know it's a very much 
 a python focused uh conference which is 
 really where our tech stack lies and 
 where a lot of our projects are within 
 bank of america 
 so hi my name is marianne shine and i'm 
 the head of hr and operations with 
 umnitza in ireland 
 so this is umnitz's first year to 
 sponsor europe python we're so excited 
 to celebrate this year and participate 
 in europe python 
 coming to ireland so umnitsa is a us 
 company with our r d based in galway in 
 the west of ireland we have employees 
 all over ireland and we thought this 
 would be a great opportunity to bring 
 them along today and participate 
 in the ecosystem the python ecosystem 
 and really learn from 
 other professionals within this area 
 this year we're actually sponsoring the 
 pi ladies lunch so nitza are very 
 passionate about gender diversity within 
 our engineering team in galway we 
 currently have 33 
 females in our team and so we're very 
 privileged and honored to sponsor the pi 
 ladies lunch which i think is taking 
 place on friday so we're very excited to 
 be here i think european python is a 
 very unique conference 
 and because i think it 
 brings people who are passionate about 
 python together 
 and really gives them the opportunity to 
 learn about the most progressive 
 practices within python and also 
 leverage the wider 
 python ecosystem

 foreign 
 so in my team execution research 
 everything starts from data 
 after getting the data we do our 
 research and analysis on this data to 
 test our ideas 
 and then finally we have to get it in an 
 output format such that trading or 
 trading strategies can pick this up and 
 this whole workflow almost exclusively 
 works in python 
 [Applause] 
 in a company that has aspirations to be 
 the best at what they do that's what 
 drives people solving problems and 
 having the best people with you trying 
 to solve those problems you can't beat 
 that 
 there are people who are actually able 
 to not only look at the data and 
 understand it but analyze it and express 
 it in a way that others understand 
 and that's i suppose that's the gift of 
 a great storyteller

 settle in we're gonna start with a 
 lightning talk soon so if you are giving 
 a lightning talk please meet me here 
 next to the stage on this side and then 
 we'll make sure that everyone's lined up 
 uh it'll be another couple of minutes 
 before we start so get settled in and uh

 in my team execution research everything 
 starts from data 
 after getting the data we do our 
 research and analysis on this data to 
 test our ideas 
 and then finally we have to get it in an 
 output format such that trading or 
 trading strategies can pick this up and 
 this whole workflow almost exclusively 
 works in python 
 working in a company that has 
 aspirations to be the best at what they 
 do that's what drives people solving 
 problems and having the best people with 
 you trying to solve those problems you 
 can't beat that 
 there are people who are actually able 
 to not only look at the data and 
 understand it but analyze it and express 
 it in a way that others understand 
 and that's i suppose that's the gift of 
 a great storyteller 
 [Music] 
 we're here 
 at microsoft and we have been sponsoring 
 era python for i believe four years now 
 it's been some time and we're excited to 
 be back here this year yeah so for euro 
 python this year 
 our team has has a few talks 
 lined up for some of the attendees so 
 we're doing that and we also have some 
 cool swag and stickers for all the 
 attendees as well some of them might be 
 limited edition we'll see 
 and we absolutely love europa python 
 because of the community the european 
 community is amazing and we 
 love being able to see them in hearing 
 person get this just this connection 
 that we don't we can't have virtually 
 but it's always not the same in person 
 is always like that 
 really great conversations and we get 
 like 
 great feedback from our users as well 
 but most importantly it's the 
 conversations about how much we love 
 python all the amazing things we do 
 with this like the european 
 community 
 so we're a brand new sponsor for uh for 
 your python this year bank of america 
 mainly here as a recruitment drive we 
 have you know plenty of open roles in 
 the python space 
 both in core hello 
 we're going to start the landing talks 
 in a minute we found a sony phone 
 with a broken screen 
 if you lost your phone is here 
 a reminder before we start with we start 
 with the lining talks is 
 if you have a ticket if you bought the 
 ticket for the social event that is 
 happening today 
 you have to go and pick 
 the 
 the ticket downstairs you need like a 
 physical one on the digital one uh yes 
 you need something like this right 
 um 
 and i think we are already on time so i 
 hope everyone is ready maybe you can 
 come here and start connecting your 
 computer 
 and then the next person is omar 
 okay 
 rodrigo 
 then we have a remote one 
 and then we have 
 peter 
 yeah 
 so while the remote one is happening you 
 can you can go next 
 um 
 can i get a handheld mic please 
 i don't understand 
 no you have to stand in the place 
 yes 
 okay who knows what's aligning talk 
 okay there is like half of the people 
 that is not raising the high the hand 
 because maybe you are tired 
 so aligning talk is a five minutes talk 
 about anything you want to talk about 
 right it can be drinking a pint of 
 guinness in the ferryman or it can be 
 something related with python 
 the good thing is that you have five 
 minutes 
 uh good news also for us is only five 
 minutes so it is really boring 
 in five minutes we can just stop i'm 
 going to have a timer in my phone 
 and if you see i need the help of 
 everyone here 
 at five minutes i'm going to raise my 
 hand and if the speaker is still 
 speaking please start clapping to 
 interrupt the person 
 those are the rules 
 and the first line in talk today is bibi 
 that is going to talk about the 
 euro python society 
 and i'm setting my timer 
 yeah 
 all right go 
 good evening how's everyone doing 
 all right 
 so i'm gonna 
 i'm gonna hopefully bore you only for 
 the next three minutes because i do not 
 intend on you know going through the 
 nerve-wracking experience of speaking 
 for five minutes in front of 
 the tough crowd over here uh 
 what i'm going to be talking about is um 
 is is basically presenting a case to 
 volunteer and help us 
 uh build the future of europe python 
 conferences right uh we've been 
 organizing it for a for for a very long 
 time this is the second time that i've 
 been doing it and uh i wanted to just 
 just basically give you an insight about 
 what goes on 
 uh 
 behind the scenes right uh in case you 
 did not know uh this conference is 
 organized by euro python society right 
 um we're completely volunteer driven um 
 we do not take a single penny out of 
 whatever is um 
 generated from the conference all of 
 this goes back to the community right so 
 um it's it's really important for us to 
 to have people who can who can help us 
 build the next generation of europe 
 python right um and and and put it 
 together um so i'm going to show like a 
 personal snippet of how 
 how much flexibility you have uh when 
 you volunteer with euro python so um to 
 to give to give you a quick brief i'm vb 
 i am a volunteer with the comps um like 
 communications so all the tweets that 
 you see on europe python all the all the 
 shitty ones are are mine uh 
 and uh and the good ones are from the 
 from the other volunteers um and so on i 
 also helped a bit about a bit with the 
 with the program and so on um 
 so here's here's what i did in march 31. 
 there's a newsletter that we that we 
 publish every 
 month and i was just playing around with 
 some stupid stuff and i put something 
 together uh and i sent this email out to 
 every newsletter subscriber with the 
 subject eat the spaghetti to forget to 
 forgetty third regretti and and i i 
 missed or or rather i messed up the 
 subject itself so instead of spaghetti i 
 wrote sagetti 
 um obviously i um 
 i handled it like a champ um and my 
 response was something like this 
 on discord i was like what omg ah 
 but 
 nevertheless um 
 we we did like because we're we're a 
 community conference people did take it 
 up with uh um um 
 you know nobody took offense and 
 everyone was was was actually quite 
 happy in fact my my best message so far 
 was i found the eat the sagetti 
 to forget either regretting the best 
 email subject ever and i'm very 
 disappointed about the correction all 
 right 
 so 
 the point i'm trying to make is if 
 you're if you're looking for um 
 if you're if you're looking for an 
 avenue wherein you can mess up 
 fix things and then get back up again 
 the next day then euro python is the 
 place for you all right 
 we we're open to new ideas we're we're 
 open to any sorts of things that you 
 want to do 
 um we're realistically we we just we 
 just want you to um to you know 
 to sort of come up um and and just say 
 hey i want to do this and we'll make it 
 happen for you right um you want to you 
 want to come up with the with the next 
 hybrid uh sort of agenda for a 15-day 
 conference you want to do this in the 
 himalayas 
 well maybe not uh else yes but 
 we're we're there for you 
 um 
 so those were the those were the messed 
 up things and here's an example of of 
 how we also try to do some new things 
 every now and then so um there was a 
 there was a chat on discord where and 
 someone was like hey we're going to 
 dublin why don't we reach out to um 
 local irish tech communities in dublin 
 and and just you know try and help them 
 out 
 and uh 
 um we just sent like couple of emails to 
 different different irish tech 
 communities and all of us in different 
 countries just got on a zoom call just 
 to discuss how best we can 
 um how best we can you know 
 put together this euro python you know 
 a lot of it um a lot of what you see 
 from food to you know um the social 
 events and whatnot was 
 was through the 
 um 
 was through the sort of feedback from 
 them 
 um so again the point is if you want to 
 help us out to put together euro python 
 in 2023 and beyond we're more than happy 
 um to have you on board with that um 
 feel free to find anyone who wears a 
 yellow yellow shirt anyone with an 
 organizer badge 
 outside we're more than happy to have a 
 chat 
 or just send us an email on volunteer at 
 the right europathon.eu thank you so 
 much for your time 
 that was perfect timing 
 okay rodriguez next 
 oh sorry 
 omar 
 yeah 
 omar and sebastian is going to do an 
 announcement 
 while 
 you configure your computer 
 perfect hi uh how many of you are using 
 vs code hands up 
 a lot of people how many of you are 
 using veeam 
 how many of you know what are dot files 
 well that's quite a few people uh how 
 many of you heard about the rip grab xa 
 fd those cli tools cool so for the rest 
 of you who wants to learn about those 
 things i'm trying to organize an open 
 space session tomorrow at 2 where i want 
 to 
 present some tools that i'm using and 
 have a chat with other people about like 
 plugins for vmv for vmvs code linux cli 
 tools dot files stuff like that so 
 tomorrow attitude 
 opens spaces i hope to see some of you 
 thank you thank you 
 so 
 next one is omar that is going to be 
 yeah replacing my name is dao 
 he's a clone of a man yeah come on cool 
 please patrick i see you in the list and 
 i don't see you in the queue 
 and rodomir 
 also if you're here you're in the list 
 okay go five minutes cool 
 um so my name is dawud i am one of the 
 founders of gradio and that is a python 
 library i'll be talking about today but 
 also here to announce the hugging face 
 radio hackathon that we're running this 
 week and until the end of next week um 
 so you can find us on the euro python 
 website and go to the events tab and 
 you'll see us right here 
 and so is anyone here interested in 
 machine learning 
 uh raise your hands okay so quite a few 
 of you good that's a good sign um so yes 
 you should definitely participate in 
 this hackathon if you're interested in 
 machine learning you don't have to be an 
 expert in machine learning at all we 
 make it really easy to create demos with 
 machine learning models um so find the 
 events tab and it'll take you to 
 our euro python organization on hugging 
 face and you can join this 
 organization just like 75 other people 
 have and upload your demos here so some 
 of you might be thinking what is grady 
 what is hugging face how many of you 
 here have heard of hugging face before 
 oh wow okay a good amount how many of 
 you have heard of gradio before 
 okay so still some of you have 
 that's good so 
 once you join this organization you can 
 upload your models and you have a chance 
 to win prizes like t-shirts and such um 
 so for those of you who have not heard 
 of gradio gradio is a python library so 
 you can pip install it within a few 
 lines of code have a web interface 
 running and wrapped around your machine 
 learning model so here's a few examples 
 here use like a sketch demo question and 
 answering image segmentation speech 
 verification so we have a library of a 
 bunch of ui elements 
 where you can wrap your machine learning 
 model around 
 and that's that's what gradio is i'm 
 sure maybe a lot of you have seen the 
 most popular radio demo here dolly mini 
 here's an example generation here 
 minions attending your python hackathon 
 how many of you have played with the 
 dolly mini demo before 
 okay so a good amount of you again i'm 
 sure you have so um if you haven't 
 definitely google dolly mini it'll be 
 the first link and type in any text 
 prompt and you'll see um generated 
 images so this is an example of your 
 gradio demo 
 you can find more examples on hugging 
 face spaces 
 we have a bunch like anime gan and 
 arcane gan and a bunch of different 
 computer vision or interesting spaces 
 you can play around with 
 so 
 once again 
 join please join the honey face 
 hackathon um and if you have any 
 questions or if you run into into any 
 issues we have a booth a table on the 
 first floor you'll see a big hugging 
 face emoji right by the banner i'll be 
 standing there omar will be standing 
 there you can ask us any questions and 
 reach out to us there 
 yeah thank you 
 cool thank you very much 
 so the next story is rodrigo 
 and he's going to talk about smoosh all 
 the things 
 i'm sure 
 that's a surprise talk that's i'm not 
 going to be talking about smoosh all the 
 things right that's just the title i 
 gave it cool um so 
 no i just just wanted to make it clear 
 after rodrigo we will have alex doing a 
 one-minute announcement 
 and then we have a remote talk 
 yeah by the way i will be interacting 
 with you 
 and i don't have a lot of time so you 
 have to be snappy in your replies okay 
 that's going to be important for me 
 can i oh oh wow okay so let's smoosh all 
 the things my name is rodrigo 
 i hope you you're all doing well and i 
 don't really like to label people but 
 you guys 
 you folks look like you enjoy python so 
 check out my python workout on twitter 
 and now let's go for a quiz so who can 
 tell me what's one plus two plus three 
 plus four 
 ten amazing so if you understand this 
 expression and the result can you please 
 clap just a little bit 
 okay that's fine perfect okay so next 
 quiz 
 what's 1 times 2 times 3 times 4 
 24 great if you understand the 
 expression and if you understand why the 
 result is 24 can you plus clap 
 okay amazing 
 now what's true and true and false and 
 true 
 that's false okay let's just pretend 
 that's the operator end i didn't have 
 much space there so it is false now if 
 you understand the expression and the 
 result can you please clap 
 okay 
 amazing everyone understands these 
 expressions right because they're fairly 
 simple 
 now the question is what's the pattern 
 here because these expressions they're 
 very they're struck structurally similar 
 to each other so what's the pattern here 
 and the pattern is we have a binary 
 function 
 in all of them 
 we have a bunch of values that i was 
 working with and when i take that binary 
 function and i smoosh all of the values 
 together i get a single results 
 so that's the pattern the common pattern 
 in these expressions 
 now is this pattern of taking a binary 
 function and smooshing a bunch of values 
 together a useful pattern 
 clap if you think it's a useful pattern 
 okay it is a useful pattern because 
 these are well-known functions or 
 well-known built-ins you've got some 
 math.prof and all 
 so this pattern is useful this pattern 
 of taking a bunch of things a binary 
 function smooshing everything together 
 into a single value and this pattern has 
 a name 
 and the name is reduce if you are thunk 
 tools you have reducing there 
 some is reduced with plus 
 math.prof is reduced with times 
 and all 
 is reduced with the operator ends 
 right so 
 sum is reduced prod is reduced mean is 
 reduced max is a reduced join is a 
 reduce 
 something else i forgot is a reduce so 
 there's a bunch of reduces that are 
 baked into the language all of the most 
 common cases 
 so why is this relevant why am i 
 spending my five minutes here talking 
 about this 
 because i think that understanding that 
 reduce is the common factor to all of 
 these functions the three examples i 
 showed and some others really gives you 
 a deeper understanding of these 
 functions 
 and it essentially means that if you 
 understand how reduce is even if it's 
 because of these specific examples you 
 have one more tool in your toolbelt and 
 as programmers we want tools in our 
 toolbelt 
 and the more philosophical point i think 
 which for me is really beautiful is that 
 when you connect all of these dots 
 things start to make sense instead of 
 being in a vacuum you start seeing how 
 everything is related and how everything 
 is connected and i just personally i 
 find it very very interesting useful and 
 nice 
 so that was it thank you for your time 
 and reach out to me 
 over there or three mile 
 bye 
 [Applause] 
 cool thank you very much 
 our next speaker is remote so 
 yeah you you you connect 
 hello how are you doing 
 hi everyone hey welcome to your python 
 where are you streaming from 
 i'm from italy 
 nice 
 yeah i hope you can hear me well 
 it's perfect so now you have five 
 minutes 
 okay 
 starting from now 
 yes go 
 okay 
 i will talk about gender version uh 
 useful tool uh 
 in this last couple of years 
 for a kind of version control for your 
 jungle models 
 well i am delhi i'm from italy as i was 
 saying and i am a foodstock developer 
 working with javascript 2 sorry product 
 and python 
 and ok let's talk about jungle version 
 by definition is an extension to the 
 general web framework that provides 
 version console for modern instances 
 what are its features 
 well you can roll back to any point in a 
 modern instance history 
 you can recover deleted models instances 
 and all of this with a simple 
 administration 
 you can 
 install using prepaid jungle version 
 and 
 adding conversion to installed apps in 
 jungle settings 
 and then you need to 
 run manage wpi 
 migrate because it's creating default 
 tables for history from all models 
 and then you can integrate it into the 
 admin 
 in your 
 mobile admin like this one 
 you need to import the version admin 
 from version 
 and 
 extend the 
 your admin version 
 the admin model 
 like this 
 after that you need to launch manage.pi 
 create initial revisions 
 because this command is creating all the 
 first 
 version in 
 general version tables internal tables 
 after that in the admin in the modern 
 admin this page 
 you will see 
 this button here 
 i think it's a little bit tiny but 
 yeah there is 
 a recover deleted contacts 
 or 
 records from your model and you will see 
 a list of deleted records 
 same for the change page you will see a 
 history button on the top right of the 
 page 
 who will open a change history for that 
 specific record 
 you have a lot of management comments 
 the 
 basic two are create initial revisions 
 for as i said create the first revision 
 of a specific record 
 you can bind it to a specific model and 
 also a custom comment 
 but 
 not only this 
 you can have a lot of other 
 special comments or create initial 
 revisions 
 and you just need to 
 use the 
 help 
 command for more informations 
 please note that for large databases uh 
 this comma 
 okay take a while so what 
 this 
 uh prefer to use it 
 binding to a specific model 
 or using these or kit for keeping last 
 durations or last 
 days 
 you can also register a model for using 
 with the api in 
 using this syntax 
 register the entire model or specific 
 fields to include or exclude 
 and 
 what about jungle restrainer if you are 
 using web api well you can use jungle 
 version rest framework 
 sorry for the wrong name 
 totally my fault i created this package 
 for 
 allowing 
 an endpoint an api endpoint to display 
 the reversion history 
 you can install like this 
 adding the reversion middleware 
 setting 
 and then you can register your model as 
 we saw before 
 and lastly you need to extend history 
 model to set in your views 
 for generous framework and this will 
 provide you 
 a lot of endpoints the first one is the 
 history of 
 revisions for a specific record 
 the second one 
 displays the specific region for a 
 specific wrapper 
 third one displays a list of related 
 records for a model and last one 
 robert a previous version 
 you have also a lot of mixing for 
 read-only 
 etc 
 and 
 that's it 
 thank you thank you very much 
 you're out of time 
 yeah sorry thank you for joining so next 
 one 
 okay 
 who was here yesterday and like basil 
 okay i think that who is still wasn't 
 here yesterday and still likes basil 
 it's great so how do would you like to 
 go to basil 
 like because there's a great conference 
 there it's 
 scipy it's a conference for the 
 scientific packages so 
 who likes psychic learn 
 yeah so here psychic learn people you 
 can meet there we have we have tutorials 
 on psychic learn pandas jupiter and 
 things and like two days two days of 
 tutorials and two days of talks one day 
 of sprints to work also on the packages 
 so they constantly get better and we're 
 very happy to announce we announced the 
 the list of session was just released 
 today so just go to the website and you 
 can see all the sessions 
 that will take place ticket sales are 
 open um 
 as being an academic conference the 
 ticket prices are moderate so if you're 
 a student your scipy is also 
 a great place to go and yeah that's 
 basically it so see you back in august 
 in basil of course adrian wants to add 
 something and if you're a maintainer of 
 any of those packages or related 
 packages we're also organizing the 
 maintainers track um that's not through 
 a cfp it's much more casual it usually 
 means we're a bunch of people sitting 
 together like a roundtable and 
 discussing common issues if you're 
 interested contact one of us cool thank 
 you very much thank you very much 
 so while the next person is connecting 
 the laptop i want to ask uh 
 patrick 
 is rodomir 
 or arturo 
 or elena 
 here ready yeah cool 
 please 
 right roller middle yeah 
 let's hope it works 
 it takes it takes a few seconds 
 you have to say a joke right here okay 
 cool no appointments required okay 
 hello you're python my name is peter 
 sobot i'm going to talk really fast 
 because this could probably be a half 
 hour talk but i'm going to give it five 
 minutes i'm going to talk about reverse 
 engineering keynote with python lldb and 
 protobuf so what is keynote if you 
 haven't heard of keynote before it's the 
 app i'm using to make this presentation 
 it's uh powerpoint but made by apple 
 it's really really nice does some smooth 
 animations and cool stuff what i don't 
 like about keynote is that it uses a 
 proprietary file format there's no way 
 to open up a keynote file and edit it 
 from python or edit it in your text 
 editor or really make any sort of 
 automation happen uh outside of keynote 
 itself so let's bust this open and 
 reverse engineer it in about five 
 minutes first off let's look at the 
 bytes of the file this is the bytes of a 
 keynote file here you'll notice that it 
 actually starts with two letters pk 
 that's a good hint that it might be a 
 zip file and that actually is because 
 the guy who invented the zip file format 
 was named phil katz and so he made the 
 header his own initials i should really 
 make a file format now that's a great 
 idea but if we just try to unzip a 
 keynote file here we can do that with 
 the unzip command of the command line 
 and it works it actually gives us all of 
 these files here and you see a lot of 
 them are jpegs so if you just want to 
 change the images in the keynote file 
 that's easy to do but there's other 
 stuff as well what if you want to change 
 the text or automate any sort of other 
 parameters of your your file 
 all of that's down here in these iwa 
 files which stands for iwork archive i 
 work as the old name for keynote if you 
 open one of these it's not actually as 
 useful there's no markers in here 
 there's something to hint at what this 
 file might be but you can scroll through 
 and kind of see some of the text that 
 was in your keynote application or your 
 keynote document there and here we have 
 with p and then tll and stuff like that 
 and you can see from my first slide i 
 have the same kind of text now some 
 characters are missing so this is a hint 
 that this might be compressed so let's 
 try and find out what compression format 
 was used here we can find this out by 
 looking through the symbols of keynote 
 itself with this long command of the 
 command line we'll use the nm command 
 and look for is it bzip maybe or is it 
 bz2 or is it deflate or is it snappy 
 these are all different compression 
 formats and this last command actually 
 gives me a bunch of output which is a 
 good hint that maybe keynote is using 
 snappy for compression so let's use 
 python for this let's uh use the snappy 
 python library open up that file that we 
 just had there and try to decompress the 
 file if we chop up the first four bytes 
 it actually works so we're actually able 
 to get some real content back and you'll 
 notice the full text content is 
 available there but there's all these 
 pink bytes there there's all these bytes 
 that are not really intelligible and 
 they don't make sense compared to the 
 text in there so there must be some 
 other encoding format being used and to 
 find that out we can go back to our nm 
 command again 
 and type all this stuff in and look 
 through all the rest of the strings to 
 see maybe is there some hint at what's 
 being used in here now keynote is made 
 by apple so something stood out to me in 
 here and that's the fact that the word 
 google shows up three times at the 
 bottom here and that's actually google's 
 protobuf library being used by apple for 
 encoding uh the keynote files themselves 
 so uh knowing a little bit about how 
 protobufs work if you have protobuf in 
 your application you need to put the 
 schemas or the the format of your 
 protobuf documents into the application 
 itself so we can do rg here rip grep for 
 the protofiles in keynote and then we 
 find them they're actually in there so 
 if we write a little bit of python which 
 i'm not going to show on the screen you 
 can extract all of that data and dump 
 that to protofiles they can just sit in 
 a directory right there and suddenly now 
 we have the schemas to decode what's 
 happening on the inside of keynote but 
 there's still one problem all these have 
 human readable names internally keynote 
 doesn't use human readable names 
 so we're going to have to bust keynote 
 open and use python to actually inject 
 code into it and extract data to decode 
 all this stuff 
 this is where lldb comes in lldb is a 
 low-level debugger it is a debugging 
 tool that you might use on the command 
 line for inspecting or debugging binary 
 applications in our case we're going to 
 call it from python so we'll do import 
 lldb and script the entire process we'll 
 import lldb create a debugger set it to 
 synchronous mode 
 and then we'll say let's open up keynote 
 so set a target to the path to the 
 keynote binary 
 then we'll set a breakpoint you can do 
 this with lldb really really easily but 
 in python it's also easy you can 
 programmatically create a breakpoint 
 here and say when the application is 
 done launching break on this method so 
 break on send finish launching 
 notification which just happens as part 
 of the boot process of any mac os app 
 then we launch the app and then 
 immediately after the app gets launched 
 we'll hit that break point automatically 
 and we can run a couple commands here to 
 grab the current thread grab the current 
 stack frame 
 and actually inject some objective c 
 code so this is to be honest the most 
 interesting part to me you can take this 
 string of objective c code inject it 
 into the process have it compiled on the 
 fly have it run and then take the result 
 as a string back in your python code and 
 once we have the result we have all the 
 information we need to turn this back 
 into 
 information we can use to decode the iwa 
 files we saw so now we can go from that 
 binary blob on the left to yaml on the 
 right hand side and if you want to 
 actually do this for your own keynote 
 presentations i happen to make a library 
 for it called keynote parser so you can 
 use kino parser directly but i hope that 
 instead of just the library you've had 
 your interest peaked a little bit into 
 how you can reverse engineer 
 applications with python and kind of 
 break things apart and play with the 
 insides thanks so much 
 thank you 
 thank you very much 
 so 
 the next one is something about 
 don't do something with mogs 
 i really like those two words together 
 all right so okay levels levels there we 
 go so i'm standing here because i've 
 made a stupid joke on internet and while 
 it didn't get me fired it got me to 
 write this short talk uh since then i've 
 transformed it into a blog post which i 
 will tweet out later so if this is too 
 fast for you and it is going to be fast 
 um maybe read it up later so of course 
 this has nothing to do with manners and 
 it's a mantra from the london school of 
 test driven development and it's about 
 third-party dependencies in tests 
 so now i'm going to tell you why you 
 should mock apis that you don't control 
 and what to do instead and as a case 
 study i will use a very simple http 
 client 
 say you are running a docker container 
 registry and sometimes you want to have 
 an overview over the containers that you 
 are in your repositories so you want to 
 have the list of the names along with 
 the tags and this data is available from 
 the http api if you don't know 
 about anything what i've just talked 
 about it doesn't matter you just have to 
 know we are going to talk about 
 to an uh http api 
 so we will write a function that fetches 
 the data from this api 
 and it returns a dictionary from the 
 repo names to the version tags for each 
 repo and we will call it git repos with 
 tags there we go so this function takes 
 a pre-configured httpx client httpx is 
 really good and we built a dictionary 
 from the repo names to the tags so first 
 we ask the catalog endpoint 
 for a list of repository names and 
 extract it from the json response then 
 we iterate over the names of those 
 repositories and for each repository we 
 will get the list of the tags and again 
 we extract them from the json response 
 and we return the dictionary all right 
 so um on the first side this doesn't 
 look that bad actually because we are 
 passing in a client so we can pass in a 
 fake client a mock if you want and that 
 doesn't talk to the network at all you 
 can return any data you want you can 
 also simulate errors which is very 
 useful yet i'm here to tell you to not 
 do this and this is not great 
 why well if you want to test this 
 you end up with this monstrosity 
 you need three nested marks just to 
 verify that if you call the get method 
 with uh if the get method returns an 
 empty list that you are the function 
 returns an empty a dictionary 
 now 
 this is the logic we are testing and 
 it's drowning in this noise 
 and the problem here is we are testing 
 business logic 
 and we have to mirror the structure of 
 an http client library 
 we have to even fake json payloads and 
 none of this belongs into business logic 
 tests so this makes the tests less 
 expressive and it also makes them more 
 brittle because you don't want to 
 rewrite your business tests just because 
 you switched out your http libraries 
 which takes us to the core point there's 
 a difference between owning a component 
 and like an http library or a database 
 driver and owning the api to save 
 component in other words if you want to 
 have an api that you don't own and you 
 want to mock it you write a thin layer 
 around it and mock that and this is what 
 we're going to do right now and i was 
 too slow switching slides i'm sorry 
 so we have a class we call it docker 
 registry client it has an httpx client 
 and we write them get repos method there 
 it is it's the same code like before and 
 we do the same thing for git repo tags 
 it gets the repo name returns the tags 
 right it's important to keep this layer 
 as simple as possible because this is 
 the hardest one to test this is 
 interacting with the dirty world so 
 adding logic into this layer means that 
 you are just moving the problems into 
 different layers that's not helpful 
 so now we rewrite our function and it 
 looks like this now look at this much 
 more dramatic now you can actually see 
 that you could make it a dict 
 comprehension something that was not as 
 obvious before so you get cleaner code 
 this is already a big win here now let's 
 rewrite the test 
 and look that only one mock one lambda 
 it's simpler the font is bigger so it's 
 clearly better 
 and um once you want to do more complex 
 tests like when get repos doesn't just 
 return an empty list 
 uh you just add a mock or a lambda for 
 the tax function 
 you don't have to have 
 a smart get method marked out which is 
 possible but messy 
 so obviously this makes more sense in 
 more complex 
 software but the same rules apply um and 
 this is it this is why you don't mock 
 what you don't own 
 i'm hinik i'm at hennik on twitter i'm 
 happy to talk about all this kind of 
 stuff i have opinions come and fight me 
 thank you 
 thank you very much 
 you still have 20 seconds let me tell 
 you more about my opinions okay we're 
 going to steal the adapter because i 
 think let me see 
 yeah i don't have the others here 
 uh 
 two reminders i have a sony phone there 
 that was in the floor here so if someone 
 loses a phone 
 and if you have a ticket for social 
 event go and pick up the physical ticket 
 [Music] 
 yes 
 hello everyone my name is patrick i am 
 one of the organizers of this conference 
 and i really want to invite you to come 
 for a run tomorrow 
 if you wanna if you wanna 
 you know choose which uh time of the day 
 you can go on discord we have a very 
 simple poll so you can choose and you 
 can come around with us uh but other 
 than running i really like uh writing 
 tools for other people and one of the 
 tools i built recently is called 
 latest.com and is i built it because i 
 was a bit frustrated by 
 you know having to find the latest 
 version of a software like python for 
 example you have to go to the website 
 you have to parse this file this page 
 and maybe 
 find it here 
 and i wanted to find to make something 
 that's a bit easier to use so this 
 latest discuss you can go type python 
 and you get the latest version 
 um 
 you can also use it from the command 
 line so you can use the curl you can use 
 it you can pop it to other commands 
 and for some reason it also works from 
 ssh so you can go there 
 and you can get the latest version of 
 python uh yeah off list useful for 
 someone uh go to latest.com and use it 
 thank you 
 cool thank you patrick 
 so next one 
 is rolam here sorry 
 i think yeah 
 i will need hdmi yeah 
 go for it 
 sorry if i was mixing 
 let's hope 
 now i need chuuk to say some history 
 about dublin where are you two 
 when i was in dublin i can i come 
 almost there 
 okay 
 um yes 
 that's okay so five minutes go thank you 
 so i want to tell you about the certain 
 uh mechanism that fish entomologists and 
 then social 
 science people have discovered it's 
 about how amps and thermites and 
 wikipedia editors and 
 open source developers 
 build large films 
 basically 
 how do you build something big right you 
 start a committee 
 and you discuss how you are going to 
 build it in 
 very tiny details 
 and then when you have it ready you give 
 the plans to the developers and the 
 developers of course go and implement it 
 right 
 only one problems 
 and and open source developers don't 
 read 
 so 
 so instead how they work is they just go 
 on the side and look around 
 and 
 see oh there is something missing there 
 i will i will add it or here there is a 
 comment that says oh this needs fixing 
 so maybe i will look into fixing that 
 so they basically use their environment 
 and 
 the pheromones or comets that are 
 added to that environment by by other 
 agents 
 working among them to decide what to do 
 and how to do it 
 and that's called 
 this way they can 
 build really really big 
 things without first planning them up 
 front 
 and 
 you know 
 the plan tends to you know 
 not survive 
 actual implementation there is always 
 changing requirements there is always 
 unforeseen circumstances that that you 
 need to take into account uh with this 
 kind of 
 of 
 you know 
 strategy you actually adapt the 
 circumstances as they are discovered and 
 it's a very uh 
 robust way of 
 building software maybe the end result 
 doesn't look great there are some you 
 know 
 extrusions that don't have any 
 use and don't don't look pretty but over 
 the years because the work of so many 
 agents is accumulating 
 over the work of previous and you you 
 get those this incremental improvement 
 huge projects huge old products i don't 
 know like emacs or uh veeam or 
 not just text editor like bld kernel 
 or things like that they really grow 
 very big and very solid and very useful 
 and that that mechanism is called stigma 
 that this mechanism of uh 
 looking at your environment and reacting 
 to it and building 
 uh the thing in by multiple agent 
 without actually communicating directly 
 there is only one problem with stigmata 
 it's uh sensitive to external stimuli 
 which is most of the time it's good 
 right you want to adapt to the world 
 around you the problem is if you have 
 ants building a nest and you put some 
 sugar around it you can divert some of 
 the ants from making them ignore the 
 pheromones and instead follow the sugar 
 and 
 this way you can kind of 
 take over the project you just need very 
 little sugar because only a few ants 
 will leave enough pheromones for other 
 ants to follow 
 what you can do 
 you can make the ants focus on just one 
 part of the 
 nest 
 that you care about and abandon all the 
 rest 
 in open source projects you can 
 recognize that this is happening if you 
 have like a bag report that everybody 
 thinks is important but it's not being 
 worked on for 10 years 
 because everybody is working on 
 something else maybe something is wrong 
 there 
 but there are more things you can do 
 if you keep moving the sugar around 
 you can 
 do something that's called move fast and 
 break things 
 so basically you prevent this 
 accumulation of quality this 
 accumulation of work from happening and 
 the product actually never gets finished 
 never gets anywhere and if there are 
 projects that are also depending on it 
 you are also destroying those projects 
 so it's a very dangerous 
 if you have such 
 such 
 interference from outside into a project 
 where stigma where the internal 
 communication happens to the environment 
 that's all thank you 
 thank you very much rodomir um now we're 
 going to welcome um sir arturo uh with a 
 talk about moc scikit learn 
 just a second while we set up the av 
 is eduardo here 
 eduardo if you're here please report 
 there 
 is it working 
 it is not working 
 do i have just to plug it in 
 no i don't have it today 
 yeah well then you need to close the 
 hdmi yes 
 i think you need to find 
 then okay 
 are you 
 yeah that's gonna be it can you compute 
 here 
 okay 
 okay good 
 hello everyone i'm really glad to be 
 here 
 i'm going to present the mooc on machine 
 learning in python with scikit-learn 
 some of you may already know it but 
 because we have already had a couple of 
 sessions 
 and 
 it's a work that we have 
 between the psyche learn core developers 
 or at least a subset of us and 
 some french institutions which are the 
 india and the france university 
 numerique and my name 
 is arturo 
 you can find me in my social networks 
 like that 
 so uh why do i have to pay attention to 
 this guy if it's so late and we all want 
 to go to the 
 social event 
 well because uh a couple of years ago 
 there was this tweet 
 from this person saying that 
 we have a regularization implemented by 
 default in the logistic regression in 
 scikit-learn 
 and 
 his he claims that probably not a lot of 
 authors 
 know about this even if it's in the 
 documentation 
 so of course 
 i mean it's in the documentation but 
 also we wanted to create a mooc for 
 people that even if they have a 
 background in machine learning they can 
 find or 
 how to use good practices 
 like 
 hyper parameter tuning so that they 
 don't really have to worry if this is 
 the 
 default value or not 
 so what makes us different uh 
 first of all i would say that it's uh 
 moderated by some of the core developers 
 as i already said 
 it's also quite good because you have 
 nothing to install in the phone platform 
 you 
 you have everything provided 
 and we also have a static version which 
 is 
 this one here 
 and it's accessible during the whole 
 year 
 but 
 in the phone platform you can also get a 
 free attestation uh whenever you have a 
 score above above 
 60 of the questions 
 we have quizzes and we have a wrap up 
 quizzes but i'm going to come back to 
 this later 
 and uh 
 also something that i find 
 quite important is that we are 
 following the spirit of open source 
 meaning that everybody can contribute to 
 the course and 
 make a pull request to say like oh okay 
 maybe this can be explore a little bit 
 more in detail maybe this was not 
 phrased correctly 
 maybe i can add up a a wrap up table 
 this kind of things so we are really 
 open to 
 to getting feedback from uh users and 
 educators 
 and that's the site where you can 
 make your pull request and this is the 
 fun 
 site that i was mentioning 
 so 
 our philosophy is hands-on you learn by 
 doing and it's divided in seven models 
 plus one introductory model 
 we have 15 video lessons that hopefully 
 are not very distractful but the other 
 way around it they are meant to make the 
 course more 
 friendly and directed 
 and also we have 70 programming 
 notebooks with 21 exercise that are not 
 graded but what we grade is this 26 
 quizzes and graph of quizzes 
 in particular the seven modules contain 
 a narrative of uh having the predicted 
 pipeline so that from the very first 
 notebook you get to explore a bit the 
 data set and you've built your first 
 model 
 great 
 and in particular you can 
 learn a lot about hyper parameter tuning 
 and don't 
 commit don't make this kind of mistakes 
 that the guy in the tweet said 
 so 
 in each session we have had like uh 
 around 105 000 
 1500 sorry 
 participants per session and a lot of 
 very positive feedback in the forum we 
 have a very active forum um 
 i just want to invite you to join this 
 common effort learn something new 
 we are opening a new session in october 
 so stay tuned 
 and many thanks to all of you 
 this is the team on left hand the 
 teachers and the right hand the 
 pedagogical 
 and technical team 
 thank you 
 thank you very much arturo 
 up next on the stage we'll have elena 
 announcing a python weekend conference 
 oh yeah 
 in the meantime i'll tell you that the 
 roster for the lightning talks is pretty 
 full today there will be another round 
 of lightning talks tomorrow and 
 registrations for those will open at 8 
 am 
 so be first 
 so you get a swap 
 is it working 
 oh my god 
 i broke it 
 what's happening 
 just 
 inside 
 did you try turning it off and on again 
 shoot 
 [Music] 
 it's a universal signal right 
 guys i'm super sorry about that 
 i'm plugged 
 i'll give it a second let's go 
 back 
 in the meantime i can announce more um 
 for instance the fact that tomorrow 
 morning at 9 00 am we'll be welcoming 
 you all here for a announcement and then 
 follow a keynote session it's going to 
 be on the gill it's something you 
 probably have never heard of 
 because it's a very very 
 foreign concept to most python 
 developers and something about 
 multi-multi-threading or processing i 
 forgot which one exactly doesn't really 
 matter it's interchangeable 
 um 
 yeah so there's that 
 we're nearly done right because i'm not 
 really good at improvising things 
 of course 
 we are working on um oh you weren't 
 joking 
 yeah sure so 
 uh 
 yeah okay it's fine 
 hi guys hey uh i'm a link i'm tech 
 community manager at one fruit company 
 kiwi.com travel and tech maybe you know 
 us 
 so with my internal python community we 
 are organizing all kind of crazy python 
 events all over the europe thanks to our 
 travel company we are traveling a lot 
 and i just wanted to announce our next 
 python weekend in barcelona it will be 
 from 19th to 21st of august and you can 
 check out all the information at uh 
 court kiwicom python weekend 
 uh it's highly intensive educational 
 event where we'll be building the 
 prototype of kiwi.com core technology 
 our eight mentors will be guiding you on 
 this process and it's completely free 
 for the community so just check out the 
 link 
 you captured that yeah 
 and ping me on twitter if you have any 
 questions about that and i will see you 
 soon talking 
 thank you elena 
 we'll now close off the lightning talks 
 with the last talk of the day 
 um i have the honor of announcing jakob 
 who is the 
 euro python society auditor and a long 
 contributing member to our 
 efforts 
 and he will talk about 
 testing inner functions 
 whatever's up there you can also see it 
 there yeah good luck 
 so i assume that you all have 
 heard about inner functions in python 
 they are functions inside the scope of 
 another function you have the basic case 
 where you have just a function inside a 
 function like 
 on my slide here i have the function f 
 with g 
 and h as 
 inner functions they're also called 
 nested functions 
 we have a more advanced 
 model 
 where we have 
 the function inside a method instead 
 and we also have the possibility of do 
 doing deepened nesting 
 so far nothing really interesting 
 but how do we test in their functions 
 we don't 
 because we can't reach them right 
 they are in an inner scope because we 
 want nobody else to 
 to depend on them so that we can use 
 them 
 to implement something that is an 
 implementation detail 
 so wouldn't it be nice if we could do 
 something like this 
 where we 
 from a package which we call nested 
 import 
 nested and as in our tests we import our 
 function f our class c and our function 
 m and then we test for exam example the 
 function g which is an inner function 
 and we used some sort of way to get 
 access to this 
 saying that well it comes from the 
 function f it's called g 
 and it needs to have 
 the 
 three variables v one and v two set 
 and then i do the test 
 and i do the same thing 
 with the other cases as well i can test 
 my 
 function h i can 
 test 
 my function k which is inside the c dot 
 foo 
 method 
 and i can do 
 nested testing where i need to fish out 
 the function n 
 and from the function n i need to fish 
 out the function o 
 well it turns out that this is possible 
 so 
 let's go see the magic because that's 
 where the real fun begins 
 so this function nested 
 takes 
 a reference to the outer function 
 we give it the inner name and we give it 
 the three variables 
 so then first we check that this is 
 actually callable which we do 
 by checking that it 
 the outer function is an instance of 
 types.functiontype 
 or types.method type and then we take 
 out the code object 
 of this 
 function 
 and then we go through 
 something called co constants 
 in this one 
 which are the actual 
 references to 
 all the constants inside this function 
 object which 
 includes all the 
 the 
 [Music] 
 inner functions 
 and an inner function is of an instance 
 of the type types.code type 
 and it has the name 
 willow 
 and if it has the name we're looking for 
 then we create a new function object 
 that contains 
 the code object of that 
 and 
 we bind the free variables 
 so that they each have a closure and we 
 do that 
 up in 
 this function 
 at the top called 
 free vars 
 oops 
 and if you want to get access to this 
 nested function 
 uh nested module then it's available at 
 this url who learned something new 
 great 
 i didn't come up with this myself i 
 found it as a 
 on stack overflow with no upvotes 
 thank you 
 thank you jacob um 
 i'd like to ask you to join me in one 
 more round of applause for all of our 
 lightning talk contributors for today 
 [Music] 
 [Applause] 
 and then i have the honor of thanking 
 you all for contributing to this lovely 
 conference day we had today the second 
 day of our conference with presentations 
 tomorrow we'll have another day so i 
 expect to see you all here at 9am sharp 
 um don't forget that tonight this social 
 event is but you do need a ticket for 
 that if you didn't get one it's going to 
 be tough 
 enjoy your evening and see you tomorrow 
 you
